## Introduction
<small>Article written by Wenweia</small>
### How has lootrunning changed since when I last played?
You may remember that, in older versions of the game, lootrunning emerged as the ubiquitous end-game strategy for making money. Simply put, mobs had a very rare chance of dropping valuable items, loot chests simulated a certain number of drops, and opening a large numbers of chests as quickly as possible while wearing loot improving armour became a surefire way to obtain items you could then sell. It is often surprising to learn that this was never actually an intended mechanic; legacy lootrunning is an example of emergent gameplay.

In line with efforts to make the game more accessible, **in 2022, lootruns were introduced as an official, core, gameplay mechanic**. They aim to gameify the previous chest-running strats people did previously. Lootrunning is now the game's principle intended end-game money making stratregy, and generally results in upwards of 1stx per hour (unless you have [really bad luck](https://wynnvets.org/wenluck)). **Additionally, due to the increased rate at which mythics are introduced through lootrunning, in general, mythic prices are an order of magnitude cheaper than they likely were when you last played**.

### Broadly speaking, how does modern lootrunning work?
Modern lootrunning entails travelling to a Lootrun Camp (there are several, each unlocked by fulfiling an assortment of prerequisites) and starting what is effectively a clock. Thereafter, **lootrunning consists of running between a bunch of nearby locations and completing various objectives**. For each objective completed, you gain additional time on your clock and an assortment of buffs/curses (akin to status effects). As you complete more and more objectives, you gain reward pulls. When you return to the Lootrun Camp you started at to finish your run, you get to redeem reward pulls for rewards (including but not limited to mythics).

### Are Lootruns Worthwhile?
<details>
<summary><strong>A guide on the extent to which modern lootruns are worthwhile over their legacy counterparts.</strong></summary>
Modern lootrunning has several benefits over legacy lootrunning (i.e. running between chests without interacting with the new systems, for example by starting a lootrun at one of the new camps). One of the biggest benefits can be found in the buffs you obtain through completing objectives. Through the modern lootrun system, it is possible to stack reward-improving buffs (including loot bonus and loot quality) higher than would be otherwise possible through legacy lootrunning. Another key benefit is the reward pull system, which introduces mythics into the game at a rate far faster than chests (generally).
</details>

### Lootrun Rewards
<details>
<summary><strong>A guide on the ways a successful lootrun can reward you.</strong></summary>
There are two ways to get mythics in a lootrun:

#### Finding Items Through Challenges
Often, challenges will involve looting chests (such as spelunking objectives). Other challenges will reward you with chests upon completion, depending on your buffs (for example, flying chests). If you have built up enough loot bonus/quality, there is a high chance these might include valuable items!
#### The End Reward Chest
The lootrunning system provide an end reward chest with a rotating pool of rewards. You get rolls for this chest from doing lootrun, finishing 1 challenge will give you a base of 1 end reward pull and there are other way to gain more during the lootrun itself.

The end reward chest is also the only way to naturally gain shiny mythics, corkian simulators and corkian insulators (apart from buying these 3 items on the trade market).

##### Shiny Mythics
These mythics are special in the sense of having a tracker. If you ever played CSGO/CS2 it is similar to a stattrak where it tracks a certain stat from mobs killed, guild wars won, major world event, etc.

While it provide no statistical advantage, shiny mythics are sought for their rarity and boasting ability. They are therefore valuable.

##### Corkian Augments
Corkian Simulators and Insulators are special items only given naturally through the end reward chest. Both are used when rerolling ID of an item and are exclusive to each other, meaning you can’t use both at the same time.

Both these item are pretty coveted for their ability, so if you find one you should take it unless you’re gunning for other rarer items in the pool. This requires you to have a lot of rolls, and therefore is not something recommended for most people.

###### Corkian Simulators
These work by blocking the reroll count when rerolling an item, for example if I rolled a Warp twice already and I rolled it a third time while using the simulator, the roll count will stay at [2], this means if i want to do another reroll the price won't increase.

###### Corkian Insulators
These  on the other hand lock 1 stat from being rolled while rerolling, so for example if i roll a Discoverer and i want a near perfect one on both XP and loot, if i rolled a 95% stat on loot bonus but only 5% stat on xp, I can insulate the loot bonus and do another reroll that will exclusively change only the xp id.

### Starting a lootrun
#### Registering for Lootruns
Before you start lootrunning, you will be told to register for the lootrun division of Silverbull. After registering, there are 16 level for the lootrun division and each level (except the highest one) unlock something new for your lootrun, ranging from extra reroll to beacons. 

It is imperative that you level up this to 15 before doing an actual full fledged lootrun as the unlock from these are crucial to having successful run. Generally, lootruns run at lower levels tend not to be very lucrative.

#### Choosing a Lootrun Camp
To start a lootrun, you must travel to a Lootrun Camp, several of which are distributed throughout the map. Lootruns take place within the general vacinity of the lootrun camp from which they originated. 

<details>
<summary><strong>A guide on the various lootrun camps and their associated routes..</strong></summary>

##### Canyon of the Lost Excursion (South)
> Camp Location:
> Camp Outside of Thesead.
> `575, 78, -5025`

The **Canyon lootrun** features the south part of the canyon centered around Bantisu Air Temple. It is the lowest level lootrun camp, so mobs have less HP and deal less damage compared to the other camps. While spelunk cave challenges here are be easy and straightforward, maneuvering around the canyon could be tricky if you aren't used to the layout. Nevertheless, it is the easiest camp for beginners to learn the flow and mindset of lootrunning with minimal obstacles (canyon cliffs excluded).

##### The Corkus Traversal
> Camp Location:
> Outside of Corkus City South gate.
> `-1560, 97, -2675`

In the **Corkus lootrun**, you will be running (or flying) across the entire Corkus island for challenges. While the whole island is easy to traverse especially with the additions of the teleport pipes at the camp building (more on that in the map strategy section), spelunk challenges are often long with multiple t3/t4 chests scattered all over the caves. That being said, you may take advantage of the high chest density here with mission picks.

##### Molten Heights Hike
> Camp Location:
> Outside of Rodoroc near Sky Islands entrance
> `1270, 10, -5130`

The **Molten lootrun** features the massive cave systems at the Lower Molten Heights. Compared to Corkus and Sky, the mobs generally have higher HP pools in exchange for the ease of travel and smaller lootrun area. Also, if you cannot cleanse debuffs, you may find yourself chugging pots a lot since it's very easy to accidentally run into fire and lava here.

##### Sky Islands Exploration
> Camp Location:
> South of Ahmsord
> `1035, 135, -4420`

The **Sky lootrun** covers all of Sky Islands, including the foot of the mountain ranges surrounding the area. Having the ability to fly using movement abilities is highly recommended because of the massive gaps and height differences between different islands, and the launch clouds can only get you so far. If you do accidentally fall into the void though, make sure to /kill quickly or you will be kicked out of the lootrun shortly after.

##### Silent Expanse Expedition
> Camp Location:
> Outside of Lutho North gate
> `990, 77, -785`

The **SE lootrun** is the most difficult lootrun camp by far, infested by high HP and high damage mobs at level 100+. Most spelunk challenges consist of less "cave-looting" and more "mini-boss combat", while the terrain poses a challenge for less vertically-mobile builds due to the constant traversal required between upper and lower Toxic Wastes/Void Plains. However, this is also the only camp where lv101-104 mythic boxes are available in chests.

### The Lootrun Itself
This section hopes to walk you through how to actually run a lootrun.

#### Mechanics
<details>
<summary><strong>A guide on the mechanics of actual mechanics behind a lootrun.</strong></summary>

## Lootrun Mechanics
Apart from the general overview provided in the introduction, lootruns have a variety of mechanics.

Namely, the timer, beacons, missions, challenges, curses, boons and trials.
As you run your first lootruns, the game will do its best to walk you through how these work. Every time you are offered one of these, there will be an accompanying description.

For a more detailed overview of all these mechanics, the [wiki](https://wynncraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Lootrunning#Lootrunning_Mechanics) provides a fairly robust explanation.

<details>
<summary><strong>At the time of writing, several new mechanics have been introduced that the wiki does not yet reflect. They are included in this spoiler.</strong></summary>

As of time of writing, some of the description hasn't been updated. These are the following changes:
- Treasury Bill Trial give out +75% pull instead of +50%
- Hoarder mission require 30 items instead of 20
- Equilibrium mission require 2 curses per 1 boon
- After clearing 4 challenges, you will be forced to pick a mission
- Getting red beacon when you're at x-1 challenges (example: 11/12) no longer end the run and will extend it like if you take white beacon
</details>
</details>

### Additional information on certain things.
In addition to the detailed info on the wiki, several other this section aims to provide a robust overview on the missions and trials you may end up with.

#### Missions
<details>
<summary><strong>A robust overview of the missions you may end up with.</strong></summary>

- The first mission is offered after challenge 4, and 3 more can be taken after completing **Gray beacons**.
- While missions are categorized by color in-game, here they will be categorized by their **functions** instead.

##### Boon Generators

> These are missions that give you Boons outside of taking **Blue beacons**. For smooth long runs, you want to take at least 1 mission in this category.

###### Hoarder, Equilibrium

- Picking up at least one of these two missions allow you to skip blue beacons entirely and are your primary boon generators.
- Try to secure one and build your other missions around them if possible.

###### Orphion's Grace, Thrill Seeker, Jester's Trick, Complete Chaos

- These missions will give boons occasionally at lower amounts (or boost boons for Orphion's Grace), but you likely still need to pick up blue beacons every so often.

##### Pull Generators

> These missions generate end-chest pulls, i.e. an increased chance for mythics from that fixed weekly lootpool.

###### Jester's Trick, Porphyrophobia, Optimism

- These three missions can give a lot of extra pulls if you trigger their effects often.

###### High Roller, Redemption

- These give you the most pulls out of any other missions and stack extremely well the longer the run goes. Never a bad mission pick.

###### Chronokinesis, Complete Chaos

- These missions give pulls passively, i.e. you usually don't need to alter your run for them.

##### Chest Generators

> These generate chests for a chance of obtaining mythic boxes.

- Materialism, Interest Scheme, Complete Chaos

##### Run Relievers

> These don't help you get mythics directly, but are quality-of-life missions that take some pressure off of your run.

###### Cleansing Greed, Cleansing Ritual, Inner Peace

- These are your main methods to counteract curses. Curses cannot be avoided in a run, and having one of these can help immensely.
- Special shoutout to **Cleansing Ritual** because it essentially allows you to ignore Red and Green beacons entirely.

###### Gourmand, Backup Beat

- These give extra beacon rerolls, which can help you get consistent aqua stacks and fish out Rainbows and Crimsons in a pinch. Having one of these also means that you can safely ignore Orange beacons entirely.
- Getting one of these missions as your first/second mission will allow you to set up the +30 white consistently.
  - Unfortunately their effectiveness drop off a cliff after around challenge 40, and if you don't have **Optimism** they don't give much extra.

###### Jester's Trick, Complete Chaos

- These sometimes give you time, which can sustain the run when you are stacking reds and cannot gain time ("red debt").

###### Stasis

- This mission requires a separate section on its own because it's really bad. Literally take any other mission but this.

##### Missions with multiple functions

You may have noticed that **Jester's Trick** and **Complete Chaos** fulfill multiple roles at the same time. These are your best missions to take early because they are flexible and allows you to pivot into any other synergies.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>A robust overview of the trials you may end up with.</strong></summary>

#### Trials

- Trials are new additions to the lootrun system since 2.1.3 (Wardrobe Wonders).
- After completing a Crimson beacon (rarely available after challenge 20), you have a choice of 2 (up to 4) trials. They stop appearing after around challenge 50 and you can pick up to 2 trials in a run.
- Completing trials is your main way to get chest rerolls and sacrifices, so try to complete both trials in your runs.

> Trials here are ordered in terms of pickability in general. The higher the trial is on the list, the "safer" it is to pick up without any help from missions. Having certain missions completed can trivialize specific trials.

##### Hubris

- Unless your run is already looking really bad to begin with, this is the freest trial.
- Do keep in mind that /kill also counts as dying, so don't go full autopilot and throw your run like that.
- If you get softlocked and are forced to /kill, gg go next

##### All In

- This is also a very safe pick, at the cost of all your sacs.
- If you don't have sacs to begin with, this trial is just a debuff for 10 challenges. Still better than ending your run though.

##### Lights Out

- If you have an active rainbow, do not pick this up (obviously). If you don't though, getting this may turn your dying run around.
- Having this as your first trial makes **Treasury Bill** and **Warmth Devourer** significantly easier. However, this is also at the cost of your mission synergies boosted by having constant vibrant beacons.

##### Treasury Bill

- Obviously, the best way to complete this is by **aqua stacking purples under rainbow**. If you get lucky (or use your beacon rerolls) and find a dark gray after the aqua, this trial ends almost immediately.
  - If you can't aqua stack, just take purples. Getting +3 now is better than +1.
- If you don't have a **Pull Generator mission**, do not pick this as your first trial unless you are forced to. The slow trial completion may cost you your second trial since it is significantly harder for crimsons to spawn the later the run goes.

##### Side Hustle

- Having **Chest Generator missions** trivializes this trial and you can usually complete it within 3-4 challenges.
- Even if you don't have any, 60 seconds is usually sufficient to get to the next beacon location while taking short detours for extra map chests.
- **This trial is UNPICKABLE if you are in red debt**, and becomes a ticking time bomb if you have **Complete Chaos**. If you took the mission **Chronostasis**, the trial becomes extremely dangerous. 

##### Ultimate Sacrifice

- Having a **Curse Cleanser mission** makes this mission much easier.
- If you get this offered before challenge 30 and you feel comfortable with your build, take this so that you don't see it in your second crimson choice. This trial is almost always a run ender the later you pick it.

##### Warmth Devourer

- Unlike failing a challenge, "consuming" just means it reduces 1 from your current maximum count, i.e. you can still complete up to 100 challenges.
- This trial is very difficult to manage without extra help from missions, as it forces you to take purples, reds and greens in rotation while weakening you at the same time. Having strong **Boon Generation missions** is highly recommended.
  - Try to pay very close attention to the challenge count. You will likely need to take more reds (and greens) than you'd think.
- If you have **Cleansing Ritual**, this trial becomes pretty much free since the mission takes the reds and greens demands away. Try to complete it ASAP regardless so that you keep as many boons as possible.
- End this trial ASAP if you have **Pull Generators**, otherwise you will get outscaled very quickly.

##### Gambling Beast

- This literally ends your run after like 3 challenges max.
- If the run is looking pretty much dead, this is a get out of jail free card. Otherwise, this is unpickable.
</details>

## Tips And Tricks

<details>
<summary><strong>The community has come up with a range of suggestions on how best to optimise your lootruns. They are grouped into this section.</strong></summary>

### Leveling Lootrun Ranks

- You need everything unlocked to get the full lootrun potential, which takes a little bit of time to get to unlocking Rainbow beacons.
- Until you unlock white beacons, you only have 12 challenges max. The fastest way to level up is to do each lootrun camp for the daily bonus (which should allow you to unlock up to around grays if you try all 5) every day.
- Make good use of the time to familiarize yourself with the map layout, and figure out which challenge(s) your build excels/sucks at.
- Once you have unlocked red beacons, you can now do full-scale runs. Do try to unlock rainbows ASAP though.

### The Real Run

- Since 2.1.3, end chest rerolls and sacs are more consistently available but are offered later in the run and in lower quantities. Therefore, **the optimal strategy has become doing max (100) challenge runs with both crimsons completed**.
- While you can always reset for the best mission lineup, "decent" runs can still be finished with multiple mythic box pulls. The strategies discussed below will focus on keeping a mediocre-average run alive consistently, while giving you the best chances to get that "god run".

#### The start of a run (1-4)

- Every run starts the same way. Focus on Blue beacons primarily, and take orange at challenge 4 if offered.
  - The reason we don't want orange too early is that it will run out when we *really* need the increased beacon choices. 
  - Taking non-vibrant aqua early is pretty greedy, as the only beacons worth aqua stacking right now are rainbows and oranges (which are somewhat rare)
- The best luck is if you get offered a **rainbow** here, which will make everything coming up significantly easier.

#### Pre-trial setup (5-20)

- The primary goal here is to ramp up your challenge count ASAP and get the run off the ground. The first objective is **taking a rainbow beacon**.
  - Take all aqua as you see them since you don't know when a rainbow shows up.
  - If both aqua and red are available as options and you aren't in red debt, take the red. It's not unlikely that you run out of challenges before the rainbow shows up.
  - Aqua stacking into orange can increase the chance of finding rainbows (and crimsons thereafter).
- After taking the rainbow, take a vibrant aqua into vibrant white right after for +30 challenges. Using both your beacon rerolls after the vibrant aqua is totally fine.
  - On the off chance that you are ~15 challenges in and still don't see the rainbow, just cut your losses and take aqua stacked white for +10.
- While you are searching for the rainbow, try your best to complete as many missions as you can, but **be sure to aqua stack all your grays** so that you have the highest chance of getting the mission you need.
  - Grays are almost always guaranteed as a beacon option if you don't have an active mission, so get greedy and always aqua stack it.
- This is optional, but try to make sure red beacons aren't active entering challenge 20+. Otherwise, there is a chance of getting completely rolled by crimsons offering **Side Hustle** + **Gambling Beast**.

#### Trial Time (20~)

- Once you get to this point, take every aqua you see for a chance to stack it on your crimson. Even if you can't stack it, just take the dry crimson regardless and hope for the best.
  - If you still have beacon rerolls at this point, you can fish for the crimson after taking an aqua.
- The highest priority now becomes **completing your trial ASAP**. Early first trial completion = early second trial offer = less things to manage.
- While you are busy with that, make sure you have picked your 4th mission by challenge 30 (Gray beacons stop appearing after 30).
- When you have completed your second trial, you have got past the most difficult section of the lootrun. Congrats!
  - Remember the goal is to complete as many challenges as you can (100). Take full advantage of your missions, and keep the run going with reds and greens if necessary.

### Keeping your run alive (Quickfire Tips)

- **Maintaining Rainbow**: In general, you only really need to take 3 for the whole run: One of them will likely be vibrant aqua stacked, giving you **60(!)** vibrant missions.
  - Constant vibrant + aqua stacking is the bread and butter of lootrunning because doing so will amplify your beacons by **6x**, or give +2 choices. You want to do that for every beacon (except blues because the effect is lower comparatively).
- **Boons and Curses**: Of all the boon choices, the static boon that scales from having up to 8 curses give you the highest boost. Because of this, try to **keep at least 8 curses active** after you have completed your white beacon to take full advantage of it.
- **Beacon Spacing**: Aquas, reds and greens do not appear twice in a row. This means that if you are about to run out of time and see both aqua and green offered, always take the green to avoid timing out because you will never see a green after taking the aqua. The same goes for reds.
- **Mission Choices**: This is different for every run, but every comfy run requires at least 1 **Boon Generator**, and at least 1 **Pull Generator** if possible for the end chest.
  - Missions that scale off from the same thing will ramp up your power expotentially. For example, **Materialism** generating free chests for **Hoarder** to get boons and **Jester's Trick** for everything else.
- **Time Triggers**: Doing /kill will reduce your time remaining by 1 min if you haven't picked a challenge yet, and you can take advantage of that. For missions that require you to "add time", you can /kill multiple times before starting a challenge to quickly complete it (assuming you aren't in red debt).
  - However, be warned that **/kill will also kill your aqua stack.** Before taking the aqua, do /kill a few times until you reach less than 10 min. Completing the aqua + the stacked beacon after will give you all 5 min from challenge completion.
- **End Chest Sacs**: Try to get at least 1 sacrifice for every run because it allows you to convert your bad RNG pulls to the next for higher chance of mythics. This usually comes from trials, unless you picked **All In**.
  - Each sac saves 50% of your unsaved pulls, i.e. 2 sacs saves 75%, 3 sacs saves 87.5%, etc.
- **Flying Chesters**: With loot bonus and loot quality boons, it is very likely that you will end up pulling mythic boxes from grounded and flying chests. 
  - To increase your chances, take the **TCC charm** (works in Molten, Sky and SE only) with high loot bonus/quality gear like **Discoverer** [>80% lb ones are around 1stx 20le]. You can also offhand a lb/lq weapon when opening chests, but they can be fairly expensive.
  - Since loot quality is harder to get from gear, prioritize loot quality first until 40% (soft cap). After that, just keep stacking both lb and lq.

## Class Builds
While boons can allow any class and any build to be lootrun-viable, the current meta consists of **Warrior** (QoL, recommended for beginners) and **Mage** (Highest speed). It's okay to lootrun with your existing characters, but you may consider dedicating a character for it in the long term.

<details>
<summary><strong>This section goes over the various builds commonly used for lootrunning.</strong></summary>

### Warrior (QoL)

**Strengths:**

- Massive AoE and CC capabilities
- Very tanky even without boons
- Good horizontal mobility (Offhanding **Idol** is highly recommended)

**Weaknesses:**

- Lower single target DPS leading to slower destroy/target mission clears
- VERY BAD vertical mobility. Needs Idol charge spam with macros or Whirlwind Strike (Bmonk node) to gain height

#### Upperscream Fallen Burst

- [Build Link: Morph Collapse (Cheapest)](https://wynnbuilder.github.io/builder/#CK0Ec0Z9iO29c0Y9GCHX9KCXdcBnnq0CjV-fVzmr2)
- [Build Link: Hero + Idol offhand](https://wynnbuilder.github.io/builder/#CJ0ytsT+q0vMxgJuXTrHn3QuOY2CUeLpEE4FWfrxFzh7kN0)
  - Replace Discoverer with Time Rift if you don't need the lb
  - Ring choices: Photon, Raging Wind, Yang (Maintain 120 int for Idol)
  - If you can't afford a **Hero**, you can use **Zephra Shredder** instead
- [How to use (by Sugvon)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xII39K3spTg)
  - You don't need the mythic aspect for lootruns

#### Generalist Screamsurf

- [Build Link: Idol](https://wynnbuilder.github.io/builder/#CK082md6Wi3sQm05IkH15kmWgcHkqU+5N8BDKU)
  - Replace Discoverer with Time Rift if you don't need the lb
- How to use:
  - Generalist reset: Scream - Charge - Uppercut - Uppercut (1 cost)
  - Cycle with <Scream - Charge - Uppercut (1 cost)> - Repeat

- Convergence build TBA

### Mage (Highest Speed)

**Strengths:**

- Very high DPS and can clear Destroy missions with ease
- Best horizontal AND vertical mobility (**Warp** is highly recommended)

**Weaknesses:**

- Very poor CC (Snake nest is often insufficient). Can often fail protect missions with ranged mobs
- Glass cannon, needs defensive boons early
- Can be difficult to hit flying mobs (Skill issue)

#### Arcanist

- [Build Link: Morph Morrowind (Cheap but significantly worse)](https://wynnbuilder.github.io/builder/#CK0Ec0Z9iO29c0a9GCHX9KCn6dTky+A-eQMV3)
  - **Morrowind** can be substituted with **Cascade** (Rainbow weapon)
- Build Link: Warp ([High Warp HPR roll](https://wynnbuilder.github.io/builder/#CK082md6Om3kQm05G01l7QdWmcTky+A-eQMV3) or [Low Warp HPR roll](https://wynnbuilder.github.io/builder/#CK082md6i14-vG86G01l7QdWmcTky+A-eQMV3))
  - You don't need a very good warp to lootrun. Get one with good %HP Regen, Mana Regen, TP cost and as high Raw HP Regen as your budget allows
  - Replace Discoverer with Time Rift if you don't need the lb
  - Replace **Pain Cycle** with **The Ephemereal** for more Mana Regen
  - **PRIORITIZE %HPR BOONS UNTIL YOU STOP BLEEDING PASSIVELY!!!** If you get too many raw HPR boons when your %hpr is lower than -100% holding your warp, you will bleed profusely
- How to use (by Sugvon)(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqSX9Ukcj9Y)
  - Disregard the winded part, mobs die too quickly to make use of it
  - Spam more ice snakes for CC

#### Riftwalker

- TBA
