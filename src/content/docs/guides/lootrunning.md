What is lootrunning? It's one of the endgame mode provided by wynncraft and is one of the best moneymaking method in the game with the mythics you can acquire (Unless you have [really bad luck](https://wynnvets.org/wenluck).

There are 2 ways to get mythics in a lootrun, either by rolling them from the end reward chest or finding them in a chest while/from clearing challenges.

*"But sir, why don't we just open chests without joining a lootrun?"*

Ah see, lootrunning provide buffs that significantly improve your chances of finding mythics. These buffs include both loot bonus and loot quality, increasing the amount of chest you can acquire. You also get access to the the end reward chest in addition!

## Unlocking lootrun routes
Before you can lootrun a certain route, there are requirement that needs to be met, you can check with the lootrun NPC to see what requirements are missing. Most of these will be completing caves around the area with occassional Quest completion requirement.

## End Reward Chest

The lootrunning system provide an end reward chest with a rotating pool of rewards. You get rolls for this chest from doing lootrun, finishing 1 challenge will give you a base of 1 end reward pull and there are other way to gain more during the lootrun itself.

The end reward chest is also the only way to naturally gain shiny mythics, corkian simulators and corkian insulators (apart from buying these 3 items on the trade market).

## Shiny Mythics

These mythics are special in the sense of having a tracker. If you ever played CSGO/CS2 it is similar to a stattrak where it track a certain stat from mobs killed, guild wars won, major world event, etc.

While it provide no statistical advantage, shiny mythics are sought for their rarity and boasting ability.

## Corkian Augments

Corkian Simulators and Insulators are special items only given naturally through the end reward chest. Both are used when rerolling ID of an item and are exclusive to each other, meaning you can't use both at the same time.

Both these item are pretty coveted for their ability, so if you find one you should take it unless you're gunning for other rarer item in the pool that require a lot of roll (not really recommended for most people).

### Corkian Simulators
These work by blocking the reroll count when rerolling an item, for example if I rolled a Warp twice already and I rolled it a third time while using the simulator, the roll count will stay at [2], this means if i want to do another reroll the price won't increase.

### Corkian Insulators
These  on the other hand lock 1 stat from being rolled while rerolling, so for example if i roll a Discoverer and i want a near perfect one on both XP and loot, if i rolled a 95% stat on loot bonus but only 5% stat on xp, I can insulate the loot bonus and do another reroll that will exclusively change only the xp id.

## Lootrun Levels

Before you start lootrunning, you will be told to register for the lootrun division of Silverbull. After registering, there are 16 level for the lootrun division and each level (except the highest one) unlock something new for your lootrun, ranging from extra reroll to beacons. 

It is imperative that you level up this to 15 before doing an actual full fledged lootrun as the unlock from these are crucial to having successful run.

## Lootrun Mechanics

Lootruns have several mechanics. Timer, beacons, missions, challenges, curses, boons and trials.

All of them interact with each other in some way or another, and as this part is explained well in the wiki, rather than regurgirating that information here, I implore you to check the wiki itself. See this **[link](https://wynncraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Lootrunning#Lootrunning_Mechanics)**

As of time of writing, some of the description hasn't been updated. These are the following changes:
- Treasury Bill Trial give out +75% pull instead of +50%
- Hoarder mission require 30 items instead of 20
- Equilibrium mission require 2 curses per 1 boon
- After clearing 4 challenges, you will be forced to pick a mission
- Getting red beacon when you're at x-1 challenges (example: 11/12) no longer end the run and will extend it like if you take white beacon

## Common Lootrun Strategies

After the introduction of trials, we found the best way to lootrun is aiming for a long run (up to 100) while also accumulating end reward pulls. The strategy itself is more freeform and each run require an adaptation depending on what is offered to the player. These are the general tips:

- Get orange and rainbow beacons early on. This is important as you're still trying to gather as much as possible. While not getting a rainbow is not exactly a run killer it will greatly improve your run

- Getting Rainbow Aqua Boosted white beacon will give you ample time to finish missions and prepare the run. If this is not possible then get the white beacon and extend it with red

- To get a long run, getting a mission that give boons is practically a requirement as the enemy will outscale you really hard. Either hoarder or equilibrium is a goodd mission for this. Hoarder is currently better due to the nerf equilibrium received as you can get much more item per chest now compared to the amount of curses you have to take

- Keep at least 8 curses once you have your run up and running, this is because the boon Bad Omen scale with how many curses you have

- If you don't have banked roll and you don't receive any boons giving mission, it is recommended to not extend the run as the enemy scaling will make it annoying to deal with

- Hubris trial can be deadly if you don't scale enough and shouldn't be taken lightly. There's also chance of bug happening that get you stuck with no way to fix without doing /kill, this WILL end the run. But it is still recommended to get this trial just for the end reroll and sacrifice

- Taking Ultimate Sacrifice trial after challenge 30 is highly discouraged as the enemy already scale quite hard at this point and disabling boons for 10 challenges could easily get you killed

- Once you have rainbow set up for the run, taking Aqua -> [Any beacon] is the recommended way to go, this is because you will get around 6 times the base reward of a beacon, for example yellow beacon offer 1 flying chest, with rainbow aqua yellow, this will give 6 flying chest instead

- At time of writing, getting hoarder and materialism beacon basically guarantee a long run. This is because of the synergy both have, materialism will flood you with items and hoarder will give you boons from these items

- There are 2 ways to reach 100 challenges, Cleansing Ritual mission or Red beacon. Red beacon's challenges will NOT give you the timer back and so it'll need to be refreshed by green beacon. Cleansing ritual meanwhile require you to keep getting curses to extend the run

- If you're doing warp arca, there's a possibility of hoarder or equilibrium giving you a copious amount of flat Health Regen. this WILL kill you because of how hpr are on warp arca buil, so be aware

- And final tip, don't be greedy on the end reward chest. Sometimes rerolling a sim isn't worth it just to gun for a shiny mythics that never come
