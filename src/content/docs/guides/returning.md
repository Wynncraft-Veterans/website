# The Returners Guide to Returning

## Legacy Items

[This spreadsheet](https://wynnvets.org/legacy-items) contains all known discontinued items in the game, as well as their approximate worth. If you have any of these in your bank, be sure not to throw them out! If you wish to sell them, **do NOT put them on the Trade Market** (the new global store) or else they will break.

For more information about legacy items, check out [this page](https://www.wynnvets.org/docs/guides/old-items/).

## Major Changes

Over the past several years, **numerous additions have been made.** You can learn more about all major changes by update [here](https://www.wynnvets.org/docs/major-changes/). Here is a brief overview:

[Housing](https://www.wynnvets.org/docs/major-changes/reborn/#housing). A balloon was added to every major city that lets you access your own private island to build on, as well as your guild's.

[Professions](https://www.wynnvets.org/docs/guides/professions/). Four resource-gathering professions and eight crafting professions were added to the game for you to make your own weapons, armor, jewelry, and consumables.

[Raids](https://www.wynnvets.org/docs/guides/raiding/). Four raids were added to the game. These are dungeon-like challenges that are intended to be completed with a party of four.

[Lootruns](https://www.wynnvets.org/docs/guides/lootrunning/). A new gamemode replaced the old method of lootrunning. Currently, there are five lootruns.

[Gavel](https://www.wynnvets.org/docs/major-changes/gavel/#the-gavel-province), [Corkus](https://www.wynnvets.org/docs/major-changes/corkus/#map-expansion), and the [Silent Expanse](https://www.wynnvets.org/docs/major-changes/expanse/#map-expansion). Three more provinces were added to the game, with a fourth slated for release sometime soon.

[Annihilation](https://www.wynnvets.org/docs/guides/anni/). A new endgame boss was added, Annihilation, which is only able to be fought every three days. It is normally fought in parties of five to ten players at max level.

## Where to Start

Depending on when you left and for how long, your gap in knowledge may vary. If you want to avoid being overwhelmed with too much information at once, **it may be wise to start a new character**. Much of the early game has changed, with quests being added, revamped, or removed entirely, and it may ease you into the new changes better than trying to resume the game with a fully leveled character.

This website is **not** meant to replace a wiki; it is meant to familiarize old players with newer concepts. If you want to read more about mechanics in detail, check out the [Wynncraft wiki](https://wynncraft.wiki.gg/).
