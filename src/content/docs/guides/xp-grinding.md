## Introduction
<small>This section was written by Wenweia</small>

### What is Metagrinding?
You may have experienced, in older versions of the game, a discrepancy between Wynn's level cap and its content offerings. This is to say that, for the longest time, leveling a character to its maximum level required an amount of experience points greater than what you would accrue through normal gameplay.

In response to this discrepancy, grinding mechanics have always emerged. These are various repeatable methods through which to farm experience. Optimising these methods (i.e. endeavouring to farm as much experience as possible, as quickly as possible) is referred to as metagrinding. The precise nature of grinding meta has changed over the years, undergoing a full loop from mob grinding to dungeons (remember CSST!), and back to the current meta, mob grinding.

### Should you Metagrind?
Before detailing *how* to metagrind, we should first discuss if it is neccessary.

**Metagrinding is no longer *required* to get to max level!** The entire questing system has been significantly reworked. Quests are far more polished and engaging than they once were and **there is now enough content in the game be able to get from level 1 to 105 without ever needing to grind/metagrind!**

**In fact, if you have not experienced the game's content since before 2020, we highly suggest leveling your first class through a playthrough (via the new quests).** It's a great way to get reintroduced to the game, to get used to new mechanics, and to get back into the swing of things.

With that said, if you are leveling a subsequent class and/or would like to skip the game's content for any other reason, you have come to the right place!

## Grinding Meta
As of writing, the best way to rapidly gain experience levels is to killing large numbers of mobs (aka Mob Grinding). Although alternative leveling methods (such as running dungeons) can still be effective, they pale in comparison to mob grinding.

### General Notes
<small>This section was written by Wenweia</small>

There are a few things that are important to consider before grinding mobs:

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to see general information about mob grinding.</strong></summary>

#### Mob Totems
Mob grinding typically involves using a mob totem (available in different quantities to different ranks) to further increase the rates of areas that already have high mob spawn rates. These mobs can then be killed on servers with double experience bombs, leading to even more combat experience. 

Note that, if multiple people kill the same mob within the radius of a mob totem, provided each player does a certain (low) percentage of the damage, both players get the full combat experience.

Also, note that totems can only spawn mobs up to a certain cap. The faster the mobs are cleared, the faster the cap is emptied, and the faster the totem can spawn new mobs. Effectively, this means the more AOE damage you and/or your party deal, the more experience you (and/or your party) will gain.

#### Relative Experience.
The experience you get from killing a mob is directly proportional to the the difference between your level and the level of the mob being killed. If a lvl 100 player kills a lvl 1 mob, they will get effectively no experience. If a lvl 1 player kills a lvl 100 mob, they will get effectively no experience.

For this reason it is always best to split your grinding journey across at least 5 different sites (i.e. move in 20 level increments or less).

</details>

### Group Grinding
<small>This section was written by Wenweia</small>

There are certain locations on the map that are particularly well suited to group experience grinding. Generally, these consist of areas that spawn so many mobs that they are impossible to survive solo.

**Any place on this list is virtually impossible to survive in solo as survival requires healing/tanking/crowd control!** This is all to say, if you join a (competent) party in one of these locations, you will probably survive, and will get a lot of experience. Another benefit to group grinding include the ability to use other people's totems/bombs.

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to see info on group grinding, including all the spots/parties/level ranges!</strong></summary>

**Simply use `/partyfinder` and look for mob grinding parties (rotten flesh symbols) that include one of the following terms in their descriptions.** Then go to the specified coordinates, stand under their mob totem, and spam AOE (area of effect) spells. If the party is set up properly, you will be safe and will get loads of XP!

<details>

<small>Party Grinding Addendum by Felixfex</small>

As mentioned earlier, party grinding is faster than most solo grinding routes, but it requires more competent players. For a good party, there should be at least two healers, preferably three or four. For damage, the focus should be on AoE attacks. Mob totems are pretty much a requirement, as the number of mobs does not scale with the player count.

**How do you get XP in a party?**

Everyone gets XP from mob kills as long as they have participated in a kill within the last 10-15 seconds, regardless of whether they are in a party or not. Participation means either getting the last hit or dealing at least 15% of a mob's HP in damage. If you don't participate, you will only get 1% of the XP from any nearby kills. The XP is not shared; everyone gets the same base XP, which is then multiplied by their equipment's XP bonus. In a party, you get a 20% XP share from the kills other people in the party get, thus granting more XP than being solo.

*(Note: Buffing and healing allies, as well as debuffing enemies, also grants you participation. I am unsure exactly which buffs/debuffs count. XP sharing and XP range still need to be conclusively tested.)*

</details>


#### (1-10) Low Level Grinding
> `NA`
**Frequency:** Nonexistant

Low levels are very quick to grind, and for this reason, lvl <10 grind parties are virtually nonexistant. You are better off following the solo guide for this level range.

#### (10-30) Mt. Wynn (Spider Pit)
> `-20 -1950`
**Frequency:** Very Uncommon

If you are lucky, you might find a proper grind parties hosted at Mt. Wynn; if so, you will be rapidly boosted from lvl 10 to lvl 30. These are so rare though that you may be better off following the solo guide until lvl 30.

#### (30-50) (Llevigar) Spider Nest
> `-2150 -4720`
**Frequency:** Common

Quite often, you will find parties in this cave west of Llevigar. Generally, this is by far the best way to get from 30-50.

Note that, on occasion, an orc will spawn. They aren't difficult for a properly set up party to deal with, but are still worth focusing on since they hit really hard for their level.

#### (50-75) Flesh (Visceral) Cave
> `-1000 -5555`
**Frequency:** Very Common

This is probably the second most popular party in the game. You are quite likely to find someone hosting a party in this range on pfinder. Just be aware of the stitched amalgam, which does quite a bit of damage for its level range.

#### (70-90) Waterfall (Living Scrap)
> `-100 -4590`
** Frequency:** Uncommon

On occasion, you might luck out and find a waterfall party. These are challenging to host and are therefore less frequent than flesh or scrapyard parties. If you can't find one, you can grind flesh to level 75 then switch to scrapyard.

#### (85-106) Scrapyard
> `-1435 -2520`
** Frequency:** Almost Nonstop

This is the main end-game leveling party, and there are almost always a scrap party or two active. Unfortunately, they are often full. To sneak into a full party, do /toggle ghosts all, look at the world that people are active in the scrapyard on, and join them. They usually won't mind.

#### (106+) Church
> `1050 -390`
** Frequency:** Very Uncommon

If you need to grind past lvl 106 (i.e. overflow), you are probably just grinding for guild XP. This is the spot to do it, but since it is mostly just used for guild XP, public parties here are very rare. Church parties are also difficult to organise.

### Grinding Solo
<small>This section was written by Felixfex</small>

Although party grinding is almost always faster, it is nevertheless still possible to get levels grinding alone.

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to see a complete guide to grinding solo!</strong></summary>

#### Preparation Suggestions
Grinding solo is far more involved than grinding in a party. Things will go a lot faster if you are prepared; this section provides some suggestions on how to do just that!

<details>
<summary><strong>A collection of suggestions and techniques to help make solo grinding easier.</strong></summary>

##### The `/class` Trick:
When you use the `/class` command and no other players are nearby, you reset the area you are in. After rejoining, the mobs will respawn instantly. This allows you to clear caves and grinding spots repeatedly without waiting for respawns.

##### Horses:
Having a horse for the early levels can be quite beneficial for getting around, as all horses can be used from level 1.

##### Organized Storage:
Preparing one or two account bank pages with all the leveling gear you need can speed up the leveling process considerably. Taking some gear with you to grinding spots also helps increase your speed.

##### Item Lock:
Remember to use `/itemlock` so you donâ€™t accidentally sell an important item or drop your weapon. The item lock remains even if you put items in the bank, so locking your grinding gear beforehand is a good idea.

##### Consumables:
Potions are your bread and butter for speeding up your grind, whether it's healing for classes that lack it or Wisdom Potions for the added XP bonus from level 45 onwards. If you already have professions in Scribing, Cooking, or Alchemism, you can use these to craft XP or damage consumables to speed up your grind even more. XP Scrolls, in particular, will earn you favor in grinding parties.

##### XP-Bombs and/or DXP Weekends
XP multipliers from bombs or a Double XP Weekend work independently of the normal XP bonus; they act as a straight 2x or 3x multiplier. The same applies if you connect Discord to your Wynn account for 24 hours of bonus XP. If you have a lot of Emeralds, you can go out of your way to buy them with Shares, but that's a steep price to pay. Champions have it quite a lot easier, as they can see other people throwing bombs on any world and have access to `/switch` for faster world switching, rapidly increasing their chances of using these bombs.

##### Mob Totems
These require a rank to obtain and, when placed, multiply the number of mobs spawned in a small area for 5 minutes. They are primarily used in grinding parties, but can be used for solo grinding

##### Sneaking:
Sneaking prevents mobs from pulling or pushing you off ledges. In the Minecraft settings, you can change "Hold Sneak" to "Toggle Sneak," allowing you to keep sneaking without actively pressing the shift key. This enables you to farm safely from secure spots.

</details>

#### Suggested Locations
Once you are prepared, it's just a matter of going to a bunch of locations and killing mobs!

This article section's author, Felixfex, suggests:

1. Corrupted Spike to lvl 5
2. Zombie Tree to lvl 13 or 25
3. Ancient Nemract to lvl 23
4. Abandoned Mines to lvl 33
5. Betrayer Altar or Wolf Den to lvl 43
6. Iron Golems to lvl 50
7. Olux Sinkhole to lvl 55
8. Flesh Cave to lvl 75
9. Switch to group grinding with Scrapyard to Lvl 105

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to see coordinates to, and an overview of, the above grind spots.</strong></summary>

*Early on, there are no real grinding spots because you advance too quickly to focus on one. You will likely reach level 10 just by following the Emerald Trail. However, if you want the fastest speed, here are two spots:*

##### (1-5) Corrupted Spike
- **Coordinates:** X: -620, Z: 1700
- **Mob-Level:** 5
- Mobs spawn near the spikes. You can kite them around the spikes and be relatively safe while doing so.

##### (5-30) Zombie Tree
- **Coordinates:** X: -350, Z: -1400
- **Mob-Level:** 5 + 21
- Mobs spawn near the tree; kite them around it, and you will be fine. Due to the level 21 zombies, you can stay here until level 30 and go straight to a later spot. Mob totems are recommended here; two should be enough to get to level 30 with good preparation. This is the first party grinding spot, but soloing also works.

##### (10-27) Ancient Nemract
- **Coordinates:** *Varied, see description*
- **Mob-Level:** 20-23
- This area has a lot of mob spawns and multiple high spots that allow you to farm safely. On the outside (`X: 180, Z: -2000`) in the Nemract region, lower HP skeletons and zombies spawn, which allow you to level to 13. Afterwards, you can more or less safely go inside Ancient Nemract (`X: 220, Z: -1900`). There are a few important points: Mobs with helmets have more HP and deal more damage but give 3x the XP. The Gilded Bowman (a skeleton in full golden armor) gives the most XP in this place, easily 20x the amount a normal mob gives. This can get you a level easily, though they do a lot more damage.

##### ( 23-34) Abandoned Mines
- **Coordinates:** X: -620, Z: 1700
- **Mob-Level:** 26
- It's a long cave with lots of mobs, some of which burrow in the ground. Use some AoE abilities and run through it. At the end, you can loot the chest and get the clear reward for the cave. After getting outside again, you can use the `/class` trick to spawn mobs quickly and run the cave again. Repeat this until you are level 30-33.

##### (30-45) Betrayer Altar
- **Coordinates:** X: 1330, Z: -2040
- **Mob-Level:** 33-35
- This spot is a good grinding spot if you donâ€™t want to travel around. It's slower than the Wolf Den + Iron Golems and a bit harder, but it gets you there easily. Be aware of one strong mob; it can one-shot you and turn invisible. Shamans have it easy here, while Warriors and Assassins suffer.

##### (33-43) Wolf Den
- **Coordinates:** X: 175, Z: -720
- **Mob-Level:** 41-45
- Another long cave. Jump down and kill all the wolves; the trainer at the end does not need to be killed as it takes too long. After getting out, use the `/class` trick again and repeat. Do this until level 40 or longer if you want.

*Levels 45â€“60 are a little boring, this is where the grind slows down.*

##### (40-50) Iron Golem Cave
- **Coordinates:** X: -120, Z: -300
- **Mob-Level:** 47
- This time it's not a cave, just a spawn spot for iron golems. There is a cave underneath, but don't go into it, as it does not give much XP. Clear the golems and use the `/class` trick again.

##### (45-58) Olux Sinkhole
- **Coordinates:** X: -1500, Z: -5250
- **Mob-Level:** 55
- This spot is a bit tricky; a lot of frogs spawn here. These frogs are slow, deal a lot of damage, and are good to kite, so bunch them up and use an AoE ability to kill them. Use the `/class` trick every time you kill them. This nets you a lot of XP fast. There are no safe spots here other than on one block at `X: -1501, Z: -5272`, so this spot is far more dangerous than the other swamp spot.

From here of out the grindspeed picks up again.

##### (52-82) Flesh (Visceral) Cave
[Meta] Flesh Cave/Visceral Cave/Visceral Remnant

- **Coordinates:** X: -1000, Z: -5555
- **Mob-Level:** 68-75
- This cave is the first real grind spot in the game. There is a very high mob density, and grind parties tend to be here a lot. There are a few safe spots in the cave; my favorite is at `X: -948, Z: -5517`. It keeps you safe from all mobs and out of range of the Stitched Amalgam.
- There is a spot at `X: -972, Z: -5530` which is higher up and attracts more mobs, but it's a bit difficult to get to consistently.
-  The last one is at `X: -978, Z: -5500`; this will attract all higher-level mobs as well as the Stitched Amalgam. The Stitched Amalgam is a problem as it pulls you towards itself and has a lot of HP, so you can't really kill it fast. To get around that, change your Sneak setting from "Hold" to "Toggle" in the options and toggle sneak on a ledge. It can't pull you down, and you can freely farm.
-  It's up to preference which spot to use. If there are grinding parties, however, you should stay near the totems or at the end of the cave (around `X: -965, Z: -5475`). A party with mob totems is recommended here but not required. This cave can be used from as low as level 46 up to level 85. You can use the `/class` trick here, but it's not really needed. I use it if there is no party around and if I have no totems left.

<summary>Click to see some other, less optimal, grind spots.</summary>

*   **Lvl 15-30: Mt. Wynn Spider Pit**
    *   **Coordinates:** X: -20, Z: -1950
    *   **Mob-Level:** 20-28
    *   This is the old party grinding spot. It's difficult alone due to the high mob count and ranged enemies, but with a party, it's an easy way to level up before going to the Llevigar Spider Nest. For the solo grind, Ancient Nemract is preferred as there are no safe spots at Mt. Wynn, and healing is difficult early on.
*   **Lvl 30-52: [Meta] Llevigar Spider Nest**
    *   **Coordinates:** X: -2150, Z: -4720
    *   **Mob-Level:** 40
    *   This cave is good for a party with mob totems, and it can get you up to the level to enter the Flesh Cave. I would not recommend it as a solo XP spot, as it has no safe spots and the `/class` trick is not very effective here. You will often find a party grinding here.
*   **Lvl 50-58: Herb Cave**
    *   **Coordinates:** X: -500, Z: -850
    *   **Mob-Level:** 51, 63, 64
    *   I personally do not recommend Herb Cave, as it requires getting over the Great Bridge boss, which is difficult with leveling gear. It is an option, but other places work as well. The upper cave is your spot for farming, as the lower cave mobs are too tanky. There is a spot at `X: -458, Z: -828` where you can farm safely with a long-range class.
*   **Lvl 48-58: Olux Swamp**
    *   **Coordinates:** X: -1540, Z: -5415
    *   **Mob-Level:** 55
    *   This is the spot I use regularly when I donâ€™t feel strong enough for the Flesh Cave. It spawns quite a lot of Nagas which give generous XP. The trees allow for safe farming, and the `/class` trick works like a charm. As it is relatively slow, I will sometimes skip it and try my luck at another spot.
*   **Lvl 75-85: [Meta] Waterfall/Living Scrap**
    *   **Coordinates:** X: -100, Z: -4590
    *   **Mob-Level:** 80-82
    *   This provides a bridge between the Flesh Cave and the Scrapyard. It is not needed for the party grind, but it works well solo. It is a lot more difficult as the enemies have more HP and deal more damage than in the Flesh Cave, but the XP is worth it. There are no safe spots anywhere in the cave, so be aware of that. Grind parties rarely go here.
*   **Lvl 80-88: Evergreen Cave**
    *   **Coordinates:** X: 50, Y: 46, Z: -4750
    *   **Mob-Level:** 84
    *   This is a good solo grind spot for the 80s. A lot of Silverfish (Evergreen Augers) spawn here, and the `/class` trick works wonders. You can, however, get easily killed as the mobs deal a lot of damage and there is no real safe spot. You can more or less safely stand at the beginning of the cave, but as the spawn area also covers the entrance, some mobs will spawn there and can push you down into the pit. If there are no scrap parties, this is the spot I grind at after the Flesh Cave.
*   **Lvl 75-85: Qira Spider Nest**
    *   **Coordinates:** X: 236, Y: 125, Z: 5425
    *   **Mob-Level:** 80-85
    *   This is a great cave for the solo grind. Do a run through it, spam AoE abilities, and after getting out again, use `/class` to reset the cave. As the spiders deal a lot of damage, healing potions are pretty much mandatory. As there are no safe spots and the respawn time of the spiders is quite high, you will probably only run through it. Mob totems do nothing here and mostly spawn spiders behind the walls.
*   **Lvl 88-95: Basalt Cave**
    *   **Coordinates:** X: 1500, Z: -5560
    *   **Mob-Level:** 88-93
    *   This cave is again wonderful for solo leveling. On the outside, there are some safe spots on the spikes where ranged attackers can't get you, and a run through the inside is possible if you have enough healing or really good AoE damage. The `/class` trick works here as well. The spot is, however, a lot slower than any grind party on Scrapyard will ever be, so only do it if you want the full solo experience or don't have any other option. I have seen parties here, but very rarely.
*   **Lvl 95-105: Angel Island**
    *   **Coordinates:** X: 1164, Y: 158, Z: -4380
    *   **Mob-Level:** 95-96
    *   This is a great solo grinding spot with some safe spots on the sides and on the crystals. The `/class` trick works here again but is mostly unneeded, and a mob totem does wonders here. You can stay here until the end of your grind. There are enemies that can pull you, but if you sneak on one of the safe spots, you will not get pulled down.
*   **Lvl 100-105: Mirror Cave**
    *   **Coordinates:** X: 1313, Y: 100, Z: -4230
    *   **Mob-Level:** 97-100
    *   This is a generally good solo grind spot with the same problems as other high spawn rate spots. There are no safe spots whatsoever. The XP is great, however, so with a bit more of a tanky build, this spot will work. I personally don't use it, but some people might prefer it. The `/class` trick is unneeded here.
*   **Lvl 80-105: [Meta] Scrapyard**
    *   **Coordinates:** X: -1435, Z: -2520
    *   **Mob-Level:** 99+
    *   This is most likely your final destination for your grind (until they release Fruma). It features a lot of powerful mobs, and solo play is not advised. A grind party for the Scrapyard (also called a "Scrap-Party") is the normal way to play here. You do not need the best equipment, but at least 7500 EHP is recommended. The most likely totem spot is around `X: -1400, Z: -2530`, as it gives the guild who holds this territory XP. How to grind here is covered in the party grind section. I personally donâ€™t solo from level 76 to 105, as it takes way too long without a grind party.
*   **Lvl 100+: Church**
    *   **Coordinates:** X: 1050, Z: -390
    *   **Mob-Level:** 110+
    *   At this spot, you will likely not grind for character XP, as it is difficult for anything under level 100 to stay alive here. Rather, it's for grinding Guild XP. As a guild, we do this sometimes with a party. Either a solid build or a competent party is needed to survive here. More on that is in the Guild XP Grind section. This can be used as a solo grind spot without totems, but you need a tanky build and not a normal XP-grind build.

## Grinding Gear
### The Lazy/Simple Setup
<small>Section by Wenweia</small>

Sometimes, getting properly outfitted is just too much effort. This is especially true if you are leveling with a group since the group will, usually, be enough to keep you alive.

</details>

### The Proper/Elaborate Setup
<small>Section by Felixfex</small>

If you are grinding solo, or just want to blaze through your grind parties in record time, you can go with something a bit more elaborate.

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to see the Detailed Equipment List & Builds</strong></summary>

First of all, use gear that you can easily obtain or already have. If you follow the guide, you will out-level your gear quite quickly. So, if you can't get a certain item, just equip something in the slots that increases damage, mana regeneration/steal, or your XP bonus. Everything else is more or less meaningless, as most grinding spots are usually rather safe, so don't sweat the details.

The equipment needed is either always accessible, requires purchase from a **[Merchant]**, is **[Quest]**-bound, or has a **[Special]** requirement. These items are either untradeable or require a quest to be completed before they can be equipped. Additionally, some items are found in **[World]** Events, but these can always be bought from the Trade Market. This guide provides alternatives to these items if needed. The items are organized into builds via Wynnbuilder.

#### Equipment (Armour/Accessories)

##### **Levels 1-12: Starting Gear**


*   **Lvl 1 Bracelet:** Secret
*   **Lvl 1 Rings:** Rarity
*   **Lvl 5 Chestplate:** Blessed Wrappings
*   **Lvl 8 Helmet:** Heliophilia
*   **Lvl 8 Chestplate (Alternative):** Guard's Garment **[World]** - More expensive as it drops from World Events, but gives a higher XP Bonus.
*   **Lvl 9 Boots:** Audacity
*   **Lvl 10 Boots (Alternative):** Silken Slippers - More XP, less damage than Audacity.
*   **Lvl 11 Leggings:** Opulenity
*   **Lvl 11 Necklace (Alternative):** Trace
*   **Lvl 12 Necklace:** Witherhead Talisman **[Special, Merchant]** - Requires any character on your account to have completed the Decrepit Sewer Dungeon. It can then be used on any character.

**Wynnbuilder Link:** [Starting Build (Levels 1-12)](https://wynnbuilder.github.io/builder/#CK0oKWjFK12c2Gx8Q7HdBAPWr6c1)

This set will be your starting point. The weapon depends on your class and will be discussed later. Abilities are up to your preference.

##### **Levels 20-41: Early Game Upgrades**


*   **Lvl 20 Boots:** Ado Saki
*   **Lvl 23 Helmet:** Sound of Silence
*   **Lvl 24 Set:** Villager Mail (Chestplate) & Villager Pants (Leggings) - The set effect provides an XP Bonus.
*   **Lvl 25 Necklace:** Durumâ€™s Serenity **[Special]** - Drops from the Bovine Boss Altar.
*   **Lvl 25 Bracelet:** Laen's Curiosity
*   **Lvl 29 Chestplate (Alternative):** Detlas Skin - An alternative to the Villager Mail set.
*   **Lvl 30 Boots (Alternative):** Adigard's Snowshoes - Not essential but provides more HP than Ado Saki.
*   **Lvl 30 Bracelet (Alternative):** Vindicator - My preferred bracelet due to the Magnet effect. It was previously quest-locked but is no longer. It gives less XP than Laen's Curiosity but synergizes well with The Jingling Jester later.
*   **Lvl 36 Boots:** Prologue **[Merchant]** - Can be bought on the Isles of Fiction for 1 Liquid Emerald and will be the best boots for a long time.
*   **Lvl 37 Helmet (Alternative):** Yume - Less XP but more damage and HP than Sound of Silence.
*   **Lvl 38 Leggings:** Chained Pixels
*   **Lvl 40 Chestplate:** Sundown Poncho **[Special]** - Drops from the Sunrise Canyon Boss Altar.
*   **Lvl 40 Boots (Alternative):** Galloping Spurs
*   **Lvl 41 Rings:** Precious - While other rings are available earlier, they are expensive, making this the first necessary upgrade.

**Wynnbuilder Link:** [Early Game Build (Levels 20-41)](https://wynnbuilder.github.io/builder/#CK0BtG60uV0RxWR8S31l7M00EEE5)

This is the build you should aim for in this level range. Again, ignore the weapon in the builder link.

##### **Levels 45-69: Mid-Game Progression**

*   **Lvl 45 Necklace:** Constrict Collar **[Special]** - Drops from the Prison of Souls Boss Altar.
*   **Lvl 49 Necklace (Alternative):** Criistal **[Merchant]** - Can be bought from the Ice Barrows Dungeon Merchant for 3 Ice Shards (3 runs).
*   **Lvl 50 Bracelet:** Binding Brace **[Special]** - Drops from the Prison of Souls Boss Altar.
*   **Lvl 51 Leggings (Alternative):** Bridge of the Divide - A good alternative to Greaves of Honor.
*   **Lvl 51 Necklace (Alternative):** Hexed Amulet - An alternative to Constrict Collar or Criistal, but you lose 10 stat points for it.
*   **Lvl 54 Helmet:** Venison - A very good helmet for this level with good mana sustain.
*   **Lvl 55 Chestplate:** Matryoshka Shell **[Special]** - Drops from the Matryoshka Idol, a hidden boss in the Iboju Village (Jungle).
*   **Lvl 58 Leggings:** Greaves of Honor - The best XP leggings in the game, though they are relatively bad otherwise.
*   **Lvl 60 Boots:** Bad Wolf - The best XP-Boost item in the game.
*   **Lvl 60 Jewelry (Optional):** Order of the Grook items **[Quest]** (Draoi Fair / Dragon's Eye Bracelet / Renda Langit) - One of these can be worn after completing the quest, but they are not essential most of the time.
*   **Lvl 64 Helmet (Alternative):** Upgraded Orc Mask **[Quest]** - Better than Venison for XP but lacks mana sustain.
*   **Lvl 66 Boots (Alternative):** Sodeta Boots - A lot less XP Bonus than Bad Wolf but provides much more sustain.
*   **Lvl 69 Chestplate:** The Jingling Jester - A wonderful chestplate for soloing that works very well with Vindicator. It provides essential healing for Assassins and Archers during the grind.

**Wynnbuilder Link:** [Mid-Game Build (Levels 45-69)](https://wynnbuilder.github.io/builder/#CK0FrW9Eqs1z2WR8S31l7y0W59k8)

This should be your build at this point, excluding any optional quest items.

##### **Levels 70-100: Late Game & Final Build**

*   **Lvl 70 Chestplate (Alternative):** Legend's Guard Plate **[Special, Quest]** - A tanky alternative to Jingling Jester, obtainable in the Temple of Legends.
*   **Lvl 70 Necklace (Alternative):** Trainerâ€™s Pendant **[Special, Quest]** - Obtained from the same altar as the Legend's Guard Plate.
*   **Lvl 70 Bracelet (Alternative):** Back-Up Plan **[Special]** - An alternative to Vindicator or Dragon's Eye Bracelet, dropped by the Altar of Sanctification Boss.
*   **Lvl 71 Helmet:** Clearsight Spectacles **[Quest]** - Better than the Orc Mask but still less mana than Venison.
*   **Lvl 77 Bracelet:** Vanguard **[Merchant]** - One of the best bracelets in the game for grinding. It's cheap, pre-identified, and can be bought at the Corrupted Infested Pit Dungeon Merchant.
*   **Lvl 77 Chestplate:** Papyrus - The final chestplate for grinding with the maximum XP-Bonus, but again, relatively bad otherwise.
*   **Lvl 79 Bracelet (Alternative):** Double Vision **[Quest]** - The second-best bracelet XP-wise in the game, but it requires the entire Realm of Light questline to be completed. Not ideal for a new character.
*   **Lvl 80 Helmet:** Galeâ€™s Sight - The final XP-Bonus helmet.
*   **Lvl 80 Boots (Alternative):** Memento - More sustain but less XP than Bad Wolf or Sodeta Boots.
*   **Lvl 80 Leggings (Alternative):** Ringlets - A very good pair of leggings, especially if you lack tankiness, stats, or mana. It gives less XP-Bonus than other leggings but is still sufficient. A good pair is rather expensive as it is used in a few builds.
*   **Lvl 80 Necklace:** Altum Spatium **[Quest]** - You get it from the "???" quest; it is the best XP necklace in the game.
*   **Lvl 87 Helmet (Alternative):** Speaker - More mana and HP but less XP and damage than Galeâ€™s Sight.
*   **Lvl 94 Leggings:** Trench Scourer **[Merchant]** - The best XP-Bonus leggings. They require you to either partially complete the quest on the character you are leveling or have another character on the same account get them. For consistency's sake, so anyone can get the items, I have not included them in the final build link.
*   **Lvl 95 Rings (Alternative):** Summa - More stats and mana sustain than Fehu, but has negative Health Regen.
*   **Lvl 97 Rings:** Fehu - The best XP rings in the game.


**Wynnbuilder Link:** [Final XP Build](https://wynnbuilder.github.io/builder/#CK0QZmB8qI2z2W24KWmS2y0GmDEC)

Your final build should look like this. It is a comprehensive setup for reaching the level cap.

This covers all the equipment that can or should be used in a full grind.

#### Sets

There are a few sets that can replace some of the mentioned items if you don't want to farm for them, but no set will be as efficient as the individually listed items.

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to see the Detailed Set List</strong></summary>


*   **Morph Set [Levels 1-105]**
    *   Parts of this set become available at different levels: Rings (12, 33), Boots (25), Leggings (50), Necklace (62), Chestplate (75), Bracelet (87), and Helmet (100).
    *   The Morph set is essentially the benchmark against which other sets are compared. It provides enough stats to wear all weapons except for a few Mythics and gives an all-around boost to almost all stats.
    *   **Note:** You can wear two of the same ring, and the set bonus will still apply. Fill any extra slots with the best items you have available.
    *   **Source:** Found in loot chests around their respective levels.

*   **Adventure Set [Level 29]**
    *   This is an all-around great set (Helmet 26, Boots 27, Leggings 28, Chestplate 29) that provides perfect stat boosts for grinding and can be worn for a long time.
    *   You can easily wear it into the mid-40s, but you will lack tankiness in the later stages. I would suggest wearing it until you can equip the Outlaw set (39), four Morph parts (Level 50), the Elf set (Level 50), or until you feel you are taking too much damage.
    *   **Source:** Drops from mobs or in loot chests between levels 22 and 33.

*   **Outlaw Set [Level 39]**
    *   The Outlaw set (Helmet 36, Boots 37, Leggings 38, Chestplate 39) is a more mediocre set that primarily increases your tankiness compared to the Adventure set.
    *   It's agility-focused, so weapon choice can be a bit of a problem. However, it works fine as a temporary set to bridge the gap to a better one.

*   **Elf Set [Level 50]**
    *   The Elf Set (full armor at level 50) is another temporary set. It provides great stats but no XP bonus, which is a drawback since the level 45-55 range tends to be the slowest.
    *   It works well until you can get the Saint Set.
    *   **Source:** Can be bought on the Isles of Fiction from the Winter Armour Merchant for 1 Liquid Emerald.

*   **Winterfest 2016 Set [Level 55]**
    *   The Winterfest 2016 Set (Ring 45, Ring 50, Bracelet 50, Necklace 55) is a jewelry set with a good XP bonus and damage. Additionally, it grants a good chunk of HP with all four pieces equipped.
    *   It works well with armor-only sets (like the Elf, Saint, or Cosmic sets). Equipping two yellow ornaments is better than two blue ones.
    *   **Source:** Can be bought on the Isles of Fiction from the Accessory Merchant for 1 Liquid Emerald.

*   **Saint Set [Level 70]**
    *   The Saint Set (full armor at level 70) is a great set for endgame grinding. The 40% XP bonus is great, and the stats are very good for its level.
    *   When paired with the Winterfest set, you can gain a 98% XP Bonus. The only requirement is to either use a water/air weapon or use powder to convert the neutral damage to one of those elements; otherwise, you will suffer from the set's damage reduction.
    *   **Source:** Can be bought on the Isles of Fiction from the Accessory Merchant for 3 Liquid Emeralds. It can be worn until level 100 before switching to a full Morph set.

*   **Cosmic Set [Level 80]**
    *   The Cosmic Set (full armor at level 80) is the best XP set in the game. It alone gives a 175% XP boost, good sustain, and well-rounded defense bonuses.
    *   Unfortunately, it requires the character to complete the '???' quest (covered in another guide). It is the best set for endgame grinding, especially for Guild Grind Parties.
    *   This set is not recommended for a speedrun, as the '???' quest is quite long.

#### Weapons

In terms of weapons, it gets a bit tricky. Every class has different strengths, and therefore, a guide is needed for each one. Not every weapon has an XP bonus, as it's often unnecessary. In most cases, you will likely want more damage rather than more XP. There are, however, a few overlaps with the weapons, which I call "weapon sets."


#### **Weapon Sets**

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to see the Weapon Sets</strong></summary>


*   **Tempo Set [Lvl 35] (Special):**
    *   A wonderful collection of weapons made just for grinding. They are effective even into the mid-50s and can carry you up to Bob's weapons if needed. They provide great sustain, an XP boost, and damage.
    *   To buy them from the Mysterious Merchant in Tempo Town, each weapon requires 9 million Time Fragments. Unfortunately, you can only gain 5 Time Fragments every 8 hours, and it requires you to complete the "Tempo Town Trouble" quest. So, if this is your first character, it will be difficult to get them. However, you can trade the fragments and weapons between characters via the bank. This is the only weapon set I would suggest you actually get for a speedrun; everything else can be replaced by other weapons.

*   **Oluxâ€™s Prized Set [Lvl 55] (Quest):**
    *   A good set of weapons with great stats and a decent XP boost.
    *   Unfortunately, you need to complete the quest "The Shadow of the Beast," which, while not very long, requires you to have Mining, Woodcutting, and Fishing at level 20. This makes this set worthless for a speed grind.

*   **Elemental Relic Set [Levels 45-65]:**
    *   This set is difficult to describe. The stats are good, and the XP bonus is great, but acquiring them is a matter of luck. You can trade or buy them on the Trade Market, but since they have a great XP bonus, you will either need to pay a lot or won't get a great weapon.
    *   Finding them is difficult as well, with the Relic Guardians spawning rarely in the Desert, Mesa, Jungle, and Nesaak Forest. The levels of the relic weapons also differ for each class (Reliks 45, Bows 50, Wands 55, Spears 60, Daggers 65). They are great for Assassins and Warriors but more or less useless for the other classes, as they can still use the Tempo weapons or the Olux's Prized weapons.

*   **Bobâ€˜s Mythic Set [Lvl 75] (Quest):**
    *   The best weapon set in the game for its level. It has wonderful stats and a great XP boost. These weapons can even carry you to the end of your grind.
    *   Sadly, they require you to complete the "Reincarnation" quest, which is rather long and has a few prerequisites. That makes them rather useless for a speedrun, but if you are grinding casually or have them unlocked, then go ahead and use them.

*   **Troubled Tribesmen Set [Lvl 75] (Quest):**
    *   The set itself is good, with great stats and a great XP bonus. The required quest is also not that hard. Sadly, the cost of the weapons is a bit annoying to fulfill. After completing the quest, you will find Ender Eyes in the Dernal Jungle, which drop the materials you need to pay for the weapons. It sounds easy, right? It takes about 2 hours to get the required materials, as the spawn rate is low and the drops can vary, with each weapon costing a different material. So, if you have the weapons, then great, do the quest and use them. But if you don't, then don't even bother getting them.

*   **Wybel Set [Lvl 90]:**
    *   The last set worth using for a speed grind. This set gives you weapons that deal relatively lackluster damage but can provide an insane 39% XP boost (comparable to the Mythic Wand "Pure").
    *   Sometimes, however, the damage is too low to farm effectively. Wybel weapons will not be recommended, especially for an Assassin or Warrior.

*   **Infused Hive Set [Lvl 100] (Quest):**
    *   The highest-level set comes from the Master Hive. Every class gets a neutral weapon with many powder slots to complement many playstyles. Like the Morph Set, they are a good comparison tool between builds.
    *   Sadly, you need to finish the Qira Hive quest, which is, by the game's standards, the second most difficult quest.

*   **Lvl 100: Infused Hive Wand [Quest]** - Good sustain and damage. Requires completing the Qira Hive quest.

*   **Lvl 54: Wintergreen** - Very good damage, but no XP bonus. Makes you very squishy.

*   **Lvl 66: Circuit Flights** - Okay damage and XP bonus; great for melee.
*   **Lvl 75: Ghorme Ndaizma [Quest, Merchant]** - Part of the Troubled Tribesmen weapon set. If you have it, use it; otherwise, don't bother.

*   **Lvl 80: Hewa** - Good XP and sustain, with average damage.
*   **Lvl 85: Procrastination** - Insane damage, but the stats are very bad and it even has a negative XP bonus. It will probably still give you more XP in the long run via last hits.

*   **Lvl 90: Wybel Carved Relic** - Part of the Wybel weapon set. Low damage but the best XP bonus.

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to see Warrior weapons</strong></summary>

*   **Lvl 7: Maltic's Old Spear** - Good XP and good damage; a great starting spear.

*   **Lvl 26: Legendary Smasher** - Great damage and AoE melee, though it has no XP bonus.

Since it can be traded between characters via the bank, it's very worthwhile if you prepare it beforehand. Grinding for it during a speedrun is not worth it.
*   **Lvl 44: Pulsar** - A great DPS spear with an okay XP bonus; a solid pick.
*   **Lvl 45: Hillich [Merchant]** - Great XP bonus and sustain; will keep you alive. Can be bought in the Craftmas section of the Isle of Fiction.

*   **Lvl 55: Sludge Slicer [World]** - A very good XP bonus and great damage, but no sustain. Found in a World Event.
*   **Lvl 59: Skyfall** - A good travel spear that still does great damage and has an okay XP bonus.
*   **Lvl 60: Relic Spear [Special]** - Part of the Relic weapon set. It has a good XP bonus but a rare drop chance. The best versions are Water and Air.
*   **Lvl 60: Polaris** - Great XP bonus and damage. The stat requirements can be difficult, especially if you want to equip Bad Wolf.
*   **Lvl 63: Remikas' Righteousness** - Great sustain, XP bonus, and okay damage.
*   **Lvl 65: Heaven's Gate** - Great sustain and damage, but no XP bonus.
*   **Lvl 70: Helm Splitter [Special]** - A weird spear. It has insane damage but is strange to use. It has an okay XP bonus and can only be dropped by the Altar of Sanctification Boss. It can be used even in the endgame, but I do not recommend it.
*   **Lvl 74: Dragon's Tongue** - Great sustain and good damage.
*   **Lvl 75: Fuunyet [Quest, Merchant]** - Part of the Troubled Tribesmen weapon set. If you have it, use it; otherwise, don't bother.
*   **Lvl 75: Bobâ€™s Mythic Spear [Quest]** - Another spear that can take you to level 105, but as stated in the weapon set section, it's not worth the effort for a speedrun.
*   **Lvl 76: Gungnir** - A top-tier XP bonus and still okay damage with no stat requirements. It's the better Wybel spear.
