- Old items have value as collectables.
- A list of legally tradable old items can be found [here](https://wynnvets.org/legacy-items), along with an approximate value ballpark.
- Make sure not to put old items in the trade-market or any other modern NPCs: they will break!
- If you have any other questions, ask in the [#legacy-trade-market](https://discord.com/channels/1313769181321236490/1316957148332298260/1375323261805662238) channel on the vets discord!
