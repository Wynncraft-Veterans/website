# [VETS] Guild Memes
Here are explanations of some of the memes present in [VETS].

## Guild Brain Cells
<small>Article written by Minethuselah</small>

Guild Braincells are extremely rare crafted rings. A single cell is created for each level the guild reaches, and that single cell is deposited into the guild bank. The cell is a finders-keepers item, meaning members are free to take the braincell at any time and not return it to the guild bank.

The meme originates from VETS' shared library of items and scrolls. The joke being that all the members in [VETS] take turns sharing a single brain cell, and that guild strategist zekrefire constantly loses that braincell. The first guild braincells were not actually rings, but rather unlabeled crafted helmets. The exact wherabouts of those early braincells are unknown, but zekrefire is suspected to have flushed them down the toilet.

## Grimtrap & "Grim Shady"

Grim Shady is a Shadestepper build that utilizes the mythic Grimtrap dagger. The Grim Shady build was designed and refined by guild member Arxhe_, though it is worn most notably by guild member Minethuselah. The official Grim Shady build was a derivative of an earlier build, titled "Grimtrap Tierstack," also worn by Minethuselah. Additionally, located in the Guild Center is an item pedestal displaying the worst Grimtrap roll the guild can find. Guild members are encouraged to come forward with their own Grimtraps if the IDs are worse than the Grimtrap being displayed.

The Grimtrap memes originate from Minethuselah constantly talking about the dagger and encouraging people to use it, despite its limitations. The status of Grim Shady as a meme also won Minethuselah the "Best Meme Builder" award at the [VETS] award ceremony on August 3rd, 2025. Minethuselah has admitted that "if Grimtrap were a woman, [he] would marry her."

The official Grim Shady build can be found in the [VETS] Discord server [here](https://discord.com/channels/1313769181321236490/1369515954018586676/1406364779693477930).

## "Wenluck" & "Arxluck"

The term wenluck refers to extremely poor luck in general on Wynncraft, though it most commonly refers to items rolled with less than a 30% average ID. Arxluck, conversely, refers to items with very good rolls including but not limited to IDed items, raid chests, and lootruns. There is no definitive value that qualifies something as arxluck, though the term is mostly reserved for items with 80% or greater average ID.

The meme originates from guild owner and founder wenweia, who has notoriously bad luck, and guild member Arxhe_, who has notably better luck than wenweia.

## ?Spin, ?Doom, ?Stare, ?Illuminate, ?Stonks

The titular Discord commands refer to a series of GIFs that play upon sending them. They feature a few [VETS] members in various scenarios, ranging from spinning around on a stool to alternating between the trade market and item identifier.

?Spin, ?Doom, and ?Illuminate all feature guild chief Nazzae. ?Stare also features Nazzae, joined by Holidaze. ?Stonks, conversely, features guild member xrl_11 completing numerous transactions via the trade market before turning to the item identifier, only to return to trading on the market.
