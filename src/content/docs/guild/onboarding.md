# Welcome to VETS!

​	**We are casual, social-first, guild** focused on providing a supportive community to returning players as they relearn the game. We are also a general community for veteran players more generally, but this package focuses on the in-game side of things. We hope you enjoy your stay!

## Policies

### Guild Rules
​	We are very informal, and in line with that, we have few fixed rules. The one overarching rule is to **please respect our atmosphere**; by following that one rule and being respectful to others, chances are you will fit in quite well here. If needed, a more formal (supplemental) list of rules can be found [here](https://discord.com/channels/1313769181321236490/1313786183733739530/1317498759516520518).

### Activity Policy
​	We are designed around the principle that most of our members, having likely played Wynn long ago growing up, are at that stage in their life where free time is a precious commodity. As such, we are built around flexibility. **All guild activities, events, etc. are completely optional. There is no obligation.**

​	The only caveat is that, due to limited slots in the guild, we may need to kick you if you are <u>away for more than two weeks</u>. If this happens, you can always re-join, no questions asked.

### Recruiting Others
​	We love making new friends! **You can add others to the guild** with `gu invite <username>`! Just please make sure they are a good match for our atmosphere and that they joined Wynn <2020.

## Guild Amenities
### Informational Resources
​	Our goal is to support old players as they reacquaint themselves with the modern game. To that end, **this website has several resources** to help you get acclimated. This includes a [high-level overview of the game's new systems](https://cdn.wynnvets.org/docs/major-changes/), an [assortment of guides](https://cdn.wynnvets.org/docs/guides/), and a [guide on what to do with your old gear (it's valuable and fragile now!](https://cdn.wynnvets.org/docs/guides/old-items).

### The Guild Library
​	After you have been onboarded, you will have access to **a library of teleport scrolls**. Soul points were removed recently, and as such, scrolls can be infinitely reused. We share a copy of every scroll on the server. To access them, do `gu man` and left click the chest.

### The Guild Island
​	A recent update to Wynncraft added housing islands! Notably these include an assortment of NPCs (featuring a parallel banking system for ingredients/keys/whatnot!) and buildings. **Everyone in the guild gets to leave the mark on the island by claiming an apartment**. Let a strategist know if you want to take us up on the offer!

### The Guild Discord
​	The guild is only part of the VETS experience! **Most announcements get posted on our Discord, and a good portion of our community hangs out there!** You can join our discord [here](https://wynnvets.org/discord)

## Guild Social Life
### The Weekly Return
​	**We host a different event every week and use it to give away guild rewards** (tomes, aspects, usually also a mythic and/or LE). It varies every week, but our goal is to keep things fun. From parties to art contests, from boat racing to class-building, we try to engage all aspects of Wynn and our community.

### Weekly Objectives
​	This is not an obligation per se, but every week, Wynn will assign every member of the guild a task. We are greatly appreciative of those who are able to finish their tasks since it directly funds the Weekly Return, but again, completing these is completely optional.
