The VETs guild has a cape, made possible through Wynntils' cape rendering feature. When wearing this cape, it will be visible to everyone else on the server -- not just VETS members!

Although primarily worn by members of the in-game VETS guild, this cape is available for everyone. This article walks through how to set up your wynntils account and apply the vets cape.

## Applying the VETs Cape

### 1. Register Wynntils!

**In-game, running [Wynntils](https://wynntils.com/), type `/wynntils token`**

A dark cyan link will appear in chat: click it!

### 2. Set up your account.

On the Wynntils registration page, enter and confirm a password. This will become your wynntils account password.

In future, you will be able to log in to wynntils [here](https://account.wynntils.com/index.php) using your minecraft username and that password.

### 3. Applying your cape
#### Option One: The fast but annoying way.
The VETS cape is pre-approved with id `67eb5826ae38eac2c63d7db7fc4fdbeaeb96b201`! Unfortunately, the Wynntils Approved Cape system is really, really, annoying to navigate.

If you have some experience with technical knowledge and a few mins to spend messing around with the wynntils site and  your browser's element inspector, follow [this guide](https://imgur.com/a/f0lTvwz).

Once that is completed, when you relog, others will be able to see your cape!

#### Option Two: The slow but easy way.
If you don't want to deal with Wynntils' Approved Cape system, you can submit it directly. To do this, simply click 'upload a file', enter `https://wynnvets.org/cape` as the file name, click open, and click save!

Note that, when using this option, it may take Wynntils staff up to a week to approve your cape!
