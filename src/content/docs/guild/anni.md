Annhilation (or Anni for short) is currently the only major world event in Wynncraft, and appears roughly once every 3 days. A countdown will be shown 11-12 hours in advance, allowing players to plan accordingly. The event itself involves facing off against Annhilation at the nether portal near Detlas.

## Annhilation as a VETS member
In the VETS guild, we try to organise our parties so that we can fit as many guild members as possible, often including new (i.e. freshly returning) players.

To attend, **we recommend you RSVP in the [VETS' discord's](https://wynnvets.org/discord)  #annhilation channel in our discord**, or, failing that, to **please show up** ***AT LEAST*** **one hour early**.

That channel also has a bot that shows when Anni is announced, allowing you to stay in the loop without having to get online.

## Annhilation Roles
To help make planning guild Annhilation parties easier, **we frequently send out a link asking you to put in your roles and region**. If you dont see it anywhere, just ask any staff member to link it.

To help us complete runs relatively easily, even with newly returning players joining, we try to differentiate our roles into those listed as follows:

### Main DPS (aka Primary)
#### What they need to do:
The main DPS is mostly self-explanatory. This is the person whose primary role is to deal damage to the boss itself. They usually stand directly behind the tank, as close to Anni herself as they can safely get..

#### What they use:
Usually this is a labyrinth or resonance user, but there can be some exceptions, especially as the meta changes.

##### Requirements
Generally, a non-buffed damage of (consistently) 400kdps is sufficient to fulfil this role.

### Secondary DPS (aka Secondary)
#### What they do:
The secondary DPS's main role is to defeat the sun, a large mob that spawns well above the ground when main boss is at 50% and 25% health. This role typically stays a bit farther back from the main DPS, and helps clear smaller mobs that attack them.

#### What they use:
This is usually a tstack epoch user, but is much more flexible than most roles. 

##### Requirements:
200kdps ranged non-buffed damage is usually enough to prevent this mob from exploding.
They also should be able to clear out random (lower-health) mobs spawning on the ground around the party core.

### Primary Healer
#### What they do:
The primary healer is in charge of keeping the main DPS alive, with the tank being a secondary priority unless they have high health regeneration. 

It is up to other players (i.e. the secondaries) to make sure they stay near the primary healer to keep their health high -- the primary healer will not follow them if they get out of range!

#### What they use:
This role is almost always a lament or absolution user.

##### Requirements:
Being able to consistently sustain heals of at least 30khps.

### Tank
#### What they do:
The tank ALWAYS stays at the very front touching Anni, no exceptions, and constantly provokes Anni to protect teammates. We most commonly have tanks that run high health regen builds to sustain themselves without needing to heavily rely on a healer. 

#### What they use:
The tank role is essentially exclusive to guardian users. 

##### Requirements:
This role refers to tanks in general, but they are usually able to tank *AT LEAST* 70kehp while running a skill tree (almost always paladin) and MIDs (almost always guardian) that sufficiently protect the primary.

### Healer DPS (Aka Healer Damage)
> **NOTE** The healer DPS is **NOT** a healer role.
> The healer DPS *kills* healer *MOBS* and is does NOT heal players.

#### What they do:
This role is responsible for killing healers (big tall mobs that heal the boss) during the fight.

Two healers are summoned on the sides of the arena after the sun appears at 50% and 25% health. Additionally, Anni will sometimes raise its left (our right) hand with a sigil, indicating that a healer was summoned behind the players.

#### What they use:
This is the most flexible role, as it only requires decent damage and mobility to move to healers easily. Sustain can also make the healer DPS's job much easier, which is why it is frequently done by lament players

##### Requirements:
This role needs to be able to safely jump across a big lava pit, then do at least 100kdps to the mobs that heal Anni. Most classes with decent movement can fulfil this role provided they have enough sustain to make it across the pit.

### Carry
#### What they do:
This is the role for players that are new to Anni or do not have a usable build put together. If you are in this role, do your best to watch how the fight plays out and learn what to do.
*Again, if you die while in a carry position, you still get the rewards!*

#### What they use:
Generally, the lower level the class, the less extra health they add to the boss.
For this reason, it can be useful for folks in this role to bring the lowest level >30 class they have.

##### Requirements:
None, although as a courtesy, if you have a build that can participate in another role, we encourage you to let us know by adding yourself to the Annhilation Roles sheet (again, ask for the link when ready).
