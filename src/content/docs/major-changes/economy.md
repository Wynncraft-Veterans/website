## Professions
<small>Article by Wenweia</small>

### New Item Tier: Crafted
The headline feature of the economy update, professions, added a new segment to the item system in the form of crafting. Unlike traditional items (for which the ID values and ranges for which are set by staff and governed by chance), crafted items are more flexible.

Ingredients (formerly junk items) droped from mobs now have various stats (IDs). **These mob drops can be combined in various orders/shapes to create items with ID values/ranges of your own selection**. The primary benefit to this is that the items you design/craft are more versitile; they can be custom-fitted to your use case and can fill in gaps otherwise not serviced by traditional items.

**The primary drawback to crafted items is that they have durability**. This means, after a certain amount of time/usage, they become useless, and need to be brought back to a town to repair. Generally, items with low max durability are more potent than items with high max durability (the trade-in being you can't use them for as long). 

### Types of Crafted Items
**Most types of traditional items can exist as crafted items**, under their respective professions. Armouring creates helmets and chestplate; tailoring creates leggings and boots; jeweling creates rings, bracelets, and necklaces; woodworking creates reliks, wands, and bows; weaponsmithing creates spears and daggers; and consumables can be created through cooking, scribing, and alchemism.

**The biggest difference is the introduction of new types of consumables**. Simply put:
- **Potions** apply a potent effect to you, for a short duration.
- **Food** applies a weak effect to you, for a long duration.
- **Scrolls** applies a weak effect to you and players near you, for a short duration.

### Obtaining Crafted Items
**Crafted items are not neccessary to play the game. They just allow a bit more refinment. You can enjoy the game without ever making or buying any crafted items!**

Having said that, if you do decide you want a crafted item, there are three routes to go about obtaining one: crafting it yourself, or getting someone to craft it for you.

#### The Easy But Expensive Way
Various tiers of almost all materials and ingredients can be purchased on the trade market. With respect to ingredients specifically, farming them is an equally valid option through a loot bonus build. In any case, **it is possible to obtain everything your item needs without ever touching profs**.

**Once you have the items you need, just ask a member of your guild to craft it for you!** As a general rule all major/active guilds will have a couple of people with max leveled profs, and those people will be happy to craft your item for free! In the case of VETS specifically, you can use the `~findprofer` command on our discord.

#### The Harder Less Expensive Way
**In most cases, a vast majority of your costs are going to come from materials. With a few dozen hours of grinding, you can level up your *gathering* professions to be able to collect these materials yourself!**

A full guide on how to level your gathering profs can be found [here](https://www.wynnvets.org/docs/guides/professions/), and the profession discord can be found [here](https://www.wynnvets.org/subcommunities/professions/). In general, it consists of using increasingly high level tools to run around in circles clicking increasingly high level resource nodes, repairing your tool occasionally when it breaks.

Professions have been significantly nerfed to make them more accessible, but leveling your gatherings is still a long process. **Expect to spend dozens of hours grinding** if you go this route, assuming you stick to double xp servers.

#### The Hardest, Grindiest, Least Expensive Way
**Nothing stops you from doing everything yourself, but it takes a *lot* of time to level your profs to the point wherefrom you can craft useful items**. 

In addition to leveling your gathering profs listed above, to go this route, you also need to level your crafting profs. This can be done by gathering thousands of materials and ingredients, and using them to craft hundreds and hundreds of items in each category.

Professions have been significantly nerfed to make them more accessible, but getting the max useful level in all of your profs **still takes hundreds of hours of grinding** to achieve. Few people do this since the above options are easy enough for almost all use cases.

## Challenge Gamemodes
When making a new character, you can now choose to start them in up to four gamemodes that add an extra challenge to your playthrough:

Special gamemodes are designed for experienced players who want to test themselves with higher difficulty settings. Aside from Ironman/Ultimate Ironman, none of them are mutually exclusive, and you can have one character with multiple gamemodes at a time. 

### Hardcore
For hardcore users, death results in all items dropping, as well as a cosmetic icon beside their username turning grey to indicate a failed challenge. (Req. Lvl 30+ character)
### Craftsman
Craftsman limits players to only equipping [crafted items](/docs/major-changes/economy#crafted-items). (req. Lvl 50+ character)
### Ironman
Old ironman (now called ultra-ironman) limited players to just their inventory their [ingredient pouch](/docs/major-changes/expanse#ingredient-pouch) (which they are allowed to store anything in). (req. Lvl 50+ character).

New Ironman (now called ironman) was subsequently introduced in the spellbound update and gives its users access to the new [character banks](/docs/major-changes/spellbound#character-banks) (but not account banks).

### Hunted
See [hunted](/docs/major-changes/expanse#hunted-gamemode).

## Trade Market

<div class="glass px-4 my-2 py-2"><center>Large portions of this section originate from <a href="https://forums.wynncraft.com/threads/returning-players-read-this-what-has-changed-updated.250419/" rel="external"><button class="glass font-semibold py-2 px-4 border border-gray-400 rounded shadow">Viro335's Thread</button></a></center></div>

The Trade Market is essentially an open-ended system that allows you to add an item to your selling list, set a price for it per number of items you're selling, and send it out to be sold! If it catches someone's eye, they may pay for it, and you will be paid in return! Now of course, you can always do the old fashioned way of trading, that is player-to-player using the shift-right click trading system.

The Trade Market also has a menu that allows you to place a wishlist of items that you want for a specific price, and if someone else wants to sell you that item at your agreed price, then you'll recieve the item, while they get their money in the menu.

## Objectives

These are simply tasks one needs to complete to get an assortment of rewards. On Vanilla clients, they appear as a scoreboard on the right of your screen. On Wynntils clients, they appear as bars in the bottom right of your screen.

Objectives can come in three variants:

### Standard Objectives
*On modded clients, these are green/yellow*

Every class gets assigned an assortment of one-off objectives below level 30. These are mostly designed to walk new players through the game and have relatively minimal/low-level rewards.


### Daily Objectives
*On modded clients, these are green*

Once the standard objectives are cleared, every day, a new objective will be generated. Stuff like "gather 30 wood" or "complete a dungeon". These generate rewards that can be claimed with `/daily` (the amount of resources increasing daily, but rarely worth it for end-game players outside of seasonal event periods. Completing these during seasonal event periods will give you a `/crate`.

### Weekly Objectives
*On modded clients, these are blue*

Once you join a guild, you will be presented another type of objective -- this time, weekly. Stuff like "mine 150 ore" or "complete 5 dungeons". If enough people do these every week, the guild will get an assortment of rewards to distribute to its members (including exclusive guild tomes, which allow you to overload your skill point allocations). The individual rewards for completing these can be claimed with `/guild rewards`.
