**What are professions?**
> Professions are a new system added in 2019
>
> They are a way to design custom weapons, armour, and consumables.
> It takes a few hundred hours to level all of your profs to the max useful level (dernic).
> You can, however, get people who have already leveled their profs to craft stuff for you.
>
> Crafting recipes consist of materials and ingredients.
> Materials are grinded by people with high prof levels. They can be bought on the TM.
> Ingredients are found around the server by farming mobs or chests.
>
> Crafted items can be great, but unlike normal items, they have durability.
> Recipe design is a matter of trade-offs.
> i.e. "This ingredient increases your potion's loot bonus, but it decreases the length of time it lasts for".
> Or "This  ingredient increases your weapon's water damage, but increases its intelligence level requirement"
