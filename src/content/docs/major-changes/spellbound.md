## The Ability Tree

<small>Section written by Wenweia and Holidaze</small>

<div class="glass px-4 my-2 py-2"><center>For further information, reference our <a href="https://www.wynnvets.org/docs/guides/classbuilding/" rel="external"><button class="glass font-semibold py-2 px-4 border border-gray-400 rounded shadow">Guide on Classbuilding</button></a></center></div>

### Abilities
In one of the most fundamental gameplay reworks since the introduction of skill points, this version introduced the ability tree system! In addition to skill points, you now get ability points every few levels, which let you select abilities. Unlike skill points, *each* ability node allows to do some specific new thing (described by hovering over the node itself). As you get more ability points, you are able to progress further down the ability tree, and the nodes you select get increasingly powerful.

#### Resetting Abilities
To clear your tree, you need to have completed [this quest](https://wynncraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Recover_the_Past) on any of your characters. Resetting your tree requires ability shards, but they are incredibly cheap/abundant. You will probably quickly end up with a surplus of them, and your guild probably likewise has an endless supply available should you ask.

### Aspects
Obtained primarily by completing raids, aspects generally enhance specific abilities within your tree. These get put in a separate window and are unlocked account-wide.

### Archetypes
<small>Section written by Holidaze</small>

Wynn retained its classes, but expanded upon them, using the ability tree to make subclasses (i.e. the left, middle, and right sides of the ability tree). Subclasses tend to be unique, with gameplay drastically different even between archetypes of the same class. Moreover, archetypes can be combined for mixed classes, assuming one can allocate their ability points well.

#### Archer
The archer is a class that focuses almost exclusively on dealing damage at varying ranges, with very few supportive capabilites overall. Its three subclasses are Boltslinger (close-up), Trapper (aoe/summons), and Sharpshooter (ranged melee).

<details>
<summary><strong>Expand this to see an overview of archer's archetypes!</strong></summary>

##### Boltslinger
The Boltslinger is the close-range option for the archer, allowing the player to summon bows that float around the player and acts as a "death by a thousand cuts" style. This subclass' main damage comes from its arrow storm, which is upgraded to spew out extremely high numbers of arrows. This is cycled with arrow bombs, creating a cycle of rapidly using each ability to do constant damage and keep guardian angels buffed.

This subclass also features some of the highest walk speed buffs in the game, with an upgraded windy feet buff for the user and allies, and frenzy allowing the player to stack extreme amounts of walk speed as they hit rapidly.

The weaknesses of this subclass are the very high mana requirements and vulnerability in close range, while not having the normal arrow shield to reduce damage

##### Trapper
The Trapper is similar to a summoner character, being able to summon 3 different pets to attack for them, while shooting traps around with bomb arrows that split up. This is the more medium-ranged option for the archer, and is usually played by charging up traps by laying them on the ground with bomb arrows, or spamming then under the boss rapidly. 

The weaknesses of this class come from dealing with traps, and getting them to charge quickly and getting enemies into them.

##### Sharpshooter
The Sharpshooter is one of few classes that can utilize main attacks (AKA melee attacks) well. The Sharpshooter functions best at long range at a safe distance, and is based around the Focus ability, allowing the player to stack up a damage buff as they attack enemies without missing.

The Sharpshooter can be built in different ways; sharpshooter can be both a spell class and a melee class. In the former case, spell damage, building focuses on the Crepuscular Ray and Phantom Ray abilities.  In the latter case, melee, one can build with high melee damage and low attack speed weapons to enhance the Twain's Arc ability, dealing heavy damage at a slower rate. It is also worth noting that sharpshooter can also be combined with elements of boltslinger to rapidly fire off melee attacks from a distance.

Depending on playstyle, the weaknesses of this subclass varies, but is quite weak and vulnerable when enemies get close, and cannot stack focus.

</details>

#### Warrior
The Warrior is one of two close range classes in the game, and focuses on getting up in enemies faces with ease. Warrior's playstyles are diverse, and can fit into just about any team. The Warrior's subclasses are Fallen (glass cannon/brute), Battlemonk (ability combo), and Paladin (tank).

<details>
<summary><strong>Expand this to see an overview of warrior's archetypes!</strong></summary>

##### Fallen
Fallen is the glass cannon, brute damage, class, allowing the player to enter a corrupted mode where they cannot gain health by any means, but drastically increasing their damage as they use their health to cast enhanced abilities. After exiting corrupted, their health is restored based on the player's attacks and kills while in corrupted mode.

This is one of the most difficult subclasses to play, as you must be comfortable being on low health constantly and be able to stay alive while avoiding enemy attacks at extremely low hp. This subclass functions extremely well with the right supports, with overhealth allowing them to build up their damage while being at high health.

The weaknesses of the subclass are how weak it can often feel without proper support, its corrupted cooldown, and constant low health.

##### Battlemonk
The Battlemonk is the ability combo subclass in Wynn. It functions around the Generalist ability, allowing the player to cast a spell for 1 mana after casting 3 different spells. This allows the player to cycle the same 3 spells repeatedly for huge cost reductions. This gives the ability to create "surf" builds, where players use a combination of charge for horizontal movement, uppercut for vertical movement, and either war scream or bash for damage.

Idol is the signature weapon for this subclass, making the charge spell very easy to use without consuming almost any mana. Being able to surf correctly can be difficult for new players, along with good cycling of spells, making this one of the harder subclasses to play in Wynn. 

##### Paladin
The Paladin is the full tank playstyle for the warrior. Almost all of its abilities focus on damage reduction and supporting allies in general. This subclass is almost always run with the Guardian mythic spear, increasing its ability to protect allies drastically by redirecting damage.

This subclass always wants to be up in the enemies' faces, using provoke to redirect attention and keep high damage allies safe. The primary weakness of this class is its lack of damage. Unless you are using a hybrid damage build, it has quite low damage output, but works fine in most normal content.

</details>

#### Assassin
The Assassin is another class that focuses almost entirely on damage at close range, with its subclasses affecting the class' positoning, damage styles, and drawbacks/difficulties. The three assassin subclasses are Shadestepper (burst/invisibility), Trickster (burst/clones), and Acrobat (consistent/mobility).

<details>
<summary><strong>Expand this to see an overview of assassin's archetypes!</strong></summary>

##### Shadestepper

The Shadestepper is probably what you think of when you imagine assassins. This subclass revolves around stacking many different buffs and debuffs together, and unleashing massive bursts of damage from invisibility.

This is done by putting marks on enemies with smoke bombs, which increases the damage enemies take, and using those marks to gain daggers to increase damage dealt, and allowing many different abilities to come together with a backstab to often hit for over a million damage in the late game.

The shadestepper typically ends up having lower health than many classes, while having to be very close to enemies, making it one of the biggest glass-cannon archetypes in the game. 

##### Trickster

The Trickster is another burst-type subclass, allowing the player to summon many clones, which copy the player's spells, along with casting some of their own in certain circumstances.

This subclass revolves around the trick debuff, which is stacked when the player's clones deal damage, and can be consumed to provide different elemental buffs based on which were selected in the ability tree. This subclass is a bit sturdier than the shadestepper, but lacks the invisibility uptime that lets the shadestepper stay alive. In return, some summoned clones will reduce the damage the player takes.

The weaknesses of this subclass are its survivability, along with getting into and out of range of enemies while surviving. 

##### Acrobat

The Acrobat is very different from the other assassin subclasses, instead focusing on mobility and constant damage over time rather than big bursts of damage. The acrobat can permanently fly given enough mana, and stays out of enemy reach while dishing out constant enhanced multihit attacks from above.

This is yet another assassin subclass with its own high difficulty, featuring precise spell cycles to stay airborne and being able to safely use its stomp ability at the right time. While the subclass can stay out of range of most attacks, many enemies have counters to it, such as pulling spells and various ranged attacks.

</details>

#### Mage

The Mage is a very diverse class that can fit well on just about any team, featuring damage subclasses, and one of two healing-focused subclasses in the game. Its three subclasses are Riftwalker (burst), Lightbender (healing), and Arcanist (glass damage).

<details>
<summary><strong>Expand this to see an overview of mage's archetypes!</strong></summary>

##### Riftwalker

The Riftwalker is the more burst-focused subclass for mage. It revolves around the winded mechanic,which can be stacked through melee attacks or ice snake, and increases meteor damage dealt. Winded can be consumed for a massive buff, allowing spells to be free, keeping winded on enemies to maintain the damage increase, and allowing the player to gain creative mode flight.

The primary weakness of this subclass is that same winded mechanic, which can often be hard to stack up properly, or take too much time to stack to maintain a good damage cycle.

##### Light bender

The Light Bender is a healing focused subclass that provides great support to nearby allies. It also features good single-target damage through its orb mechanics, which will follow up as the player uses melee attacks.

This subclass is almost always run with parts of the Riftwalker tree, which has great synergy with winded. The playstyle of the Light Bender involves constantly healing to keep its orb health high, so they can keep the orbs attacking constantly, while standing near other players to share that healing.

The Light Bender's weaknesses are that even with the winded buff, it can still take time to ramp up damage.

##### Arcanist

The Arcanist is the only Mage subclass that cannot heal, instead trading the heal ability for a mana bank that can be given to the player. The Arcanist is a full damage mage subclass, dealing damage over time through massive amounts of spells being cast at once.

The Arcanist's mana bank is charged through hitting enemies with abilities, and when used with enough mana, will recast the last 5 spells used. This allows the player to be casting spells through the mana bank, and as normal at the same time, while gaining a self-sustaining amount of mana to draw from.

The biggest weakness of the subclass is its survivability, since it cannot heal and does not gain very high movement buffs like the Riftwalker does.

</details>

#### Shaman 

The Shaman is the lowest effective health class in the game, taking significantly more damage than other classes, but can be used in an extremely diverse set of playstyles. The Shaman's subclasses are the Summoner (general), Ritualist (utility), and Acolyte (healing).

<details>
<summary><strong>Expand this to see an overview of assassin's archetypes!</strong></summary>

##### Summoner

The Summoner is quite self-explanatory in its name. This subclass focuses on summoning many totems and minions to constantly attack enemies with ease. The majority of damage that comes from this subclass comes from its puppet summons, and the aura spell from 3-4 totems at once.

The Summoner is one of the easier classes to play in many situations, but can sometimes be difficult to keep track of ability uptime and totem locations. In addition, the summoner features low amounts of healing for themselves and nearby players, and is able to fuel mana into allies, giving it decent supportive capabilities.

The weaknesses of the summoner are that the minions can be unpredictable at times, and can have low single target damage if they are split up, along with the Shaman's naturally low effective health.

##### Ritualist

The Ritualist is a subclass, focusing on different masks that give varying buffs and debuffs that the player can switch between, with a final ability allowing all masks to be used at once under the right circumstances.

The Ritualist is usually used to support the other shaman subclasses, but can sometimes be used alone in some builds. It can be quite useful for certain forms of utility, for example, some ingredient farming. It can also be convenient for casual content, although rarely excels at specific things.

This is the subclass' primary weakness, the challenges associated with being a pure ritualist (i.e. not branching off into the other subclasses as well).

##### Acolyte
The Acolyte is one of two healing focused subclasses in the game, however, it does not lack damage at all. The Acolyte focuses on a resource bar of blood that the entire kit is based around. This is filled few a few different means, but can primarily come from draining the user's health, and bleeding enemies within the totem's range.

The acolyte can use three different abilities to consume this blood, with aura now casting a healing and damaging wave. Additionally, holding shift while casting totem or uproot can cast entirely new abilities. When shift-casting totem, tentacles give bleeding enemies damage vulerability and deal damage, while shift-casting uproot can cast a beam that gives allies overhealth and damages enemies.

Though this subclass does not lack damage, it is one of the most vulnerable classes in the game, since the user must deal with decreased Shaman effective health, along with constant health drain from totems.

## Festivals

<small>Section written by Wenweia</small>

### Festival Seasons
Previously, Wynn would organise a unique event or quest for each major holiday. These have been standardised and replaced with a rotation of four seasonal festivals. Each festival redecorates detlas, has an event area reachable from detlas, implements some recurring minigames, and adds some cosmetics.

*Wynnter/Craftsmas* festivities were replaced with the *Festival of the Blizzard* (Winter) and *Hallowynn* festivities were replaced with the *Festival of the Spirits* (Autumn). Although spring and summer did not previously have their own events, they do now in the form of the *Festival of  the Heroes* (Spring) and the *Festival of the Bonfire* (Summer).

### Isles of Fiction
With the systemisation of seasonal content, unique items introduced in past holiday events are can now be accessed year-round via a newly introduced merchant island. For inflated prices, merchants on the Isles of Fiction will sell you armour, accessories, weapons, and the like temporarily introduced in past events.

## Lootruns

<small>Section written by Wenweia</small>

In older versions of the game, lootrunning was an emergant gameplay wherein players would run around the world opening as many chests as possible with as much loot bonus as possible. *This has changed.* Wynn's recent goal has been to increase the game's accessibility, and in line with that, lootrunning was made an official, user-friendly, mechanic. It's effectively a minigame now. 

Modern lootrunning entails travelling to a Lootrun Camp (there are several, each unlocked by fulfiling an assortment of prerequisites) and starting what is effectively a clock. Thereafter, *lootrunning consists of running between a bunch of nearby locations and completing various objectives*. For each objective completed, you gain additional time on your clock and an assortment of buffs/curses (akin to status effects). As you complete more and more objectives, you gain reward pulls.

Due to reward pulls and the accessibility of this mechanic, *mythic prices have dropped drastically across the board, such that they are now within reach for most players*. Items replacing mythic-priced items in rarity are shinies (described in the guide) and anni mythics (mythics that do not get dropped via lootruns, but instead spawn in via [Annhilation](https://www.wynnvets.org/docs/major-changes/rekindled/#major))

## Misc Changes

<small>Section written by Wenweia</small>

### Prof Nerf
Historically, professions were an extreme end-game time sink that required OSRS-level grinding dedication to max. Getting oneself to the maximum useful level required over a thousand hours of grinding, and getting maximum possible level required many times that.

Beginning in reborn, continued into rekindled, but especially notable in Spellbound, Wynn has made a concerted effort to reduce the severity of professions. These have included adding safer, more dense, grindspots; speciality grindspots with local experience buffs, droprate totems, gathering speed/experience ingredients, territory boosts, curve adjustments, and much more.

Having said that, despite professions now being far more accessible, they are still by no means required. And they still have the potential to suck up considerable time.

### Character Banks
Historically, everyone had one multi-page account bank, shared between all their classes and accessible via using the enderchest in many major cities. Spellbound added an *additional* set of pages per character (class). These new pages are unique in that they can only contain contents from (i.e. can only be accessed by) the class you are currently using.

> **When you first log in after returning, you may an empty bank. This is normal!**
> **Your [items] (https://www.wynnvets.org/docs/guides/old-items/) moved to your account bank!**<br>
> The new default page shown when opening an enderchest is your character bank.
> To switch to your account bank, click the chest symbol at the bottom of the UI!

## Ranks

<small>Section written by Wenweia</small>

Primarily in reaction to changing policies from Microsoft/Mojang, both the number of ranks and their contents has likely changed since you last played.

Notwithstanding some major changes in 2014 which were major enough to warrant [their own article](https://www.wynnvets.org/docs/major-changes/mobs/#eula-changes) and some major cosmetic changes in 2025 which were also major enough to warrent [their own article](https://www.wynnvets.org/docs/major-changes/rekindled/#store-stuffs), most of Wynn's store changes have been relatively gradual.

Spellbound is another example of an update that contained changes major enough to warrent their own article, and to avoid spreading out rank changes across the entire changes overview, we are going to concentrate all of that information here. Below is a broad charactarisation of Wynn's current ranks; it includes many changes made in spellbound, but also, encompasses changes made across other releases.

### Normal Ranks
Currently, Wynn's paid rank structure is as follows:
**Default < VIP < VIP+ < HERO < HERO+ < CHAMPION**
These ranks were respectively implemented after 0.0, 1.0, 1.14, 2.1, and 1.20.

Most ranks simply build on their previous ones, adding in increasing amounts of visibility perks, totems, customisation of crafted items, slots for classes and islands, bank and trade market space, housing customisation and visibility, etc.

Higher ranks also have an easier time connecting to specific servers, can have more pets, and some class-specific/niche features such as bombbell (champion). Generally, ranks are not needed to play the server, but can become useful if you stick around for a while.

Lower ranks focus on making the server more convenient to access/play on, with later ranks focusing on scaling gameplay. Therefore, *later ranks (especially champion) are generally only useful for highly invested players*, especially those who have spent way too much time on profs, those who make their in-game income trading on the market, and those who make their in-game income farming bulk ingredients.

### Subscription Ranks
Wynn added a subscription rank, Silverbull, which is billed as an addon to the normal ranks detailed above. *Silverbull is generally most useful for people who enjoy cosmetics*.

In general, for a monthly cost, it will (among other things) accrue untradable silverbull shares (effectively small giftcards only usable by yourself), incrasingly colourful armour/weapon glints (cosmetics), boost the number of crates you get, and allow you to more easily upgrade your cosmetics (via a reduced scrappinig threshold).

## Silverbull Shares

<small>Section written by Wenweia</small>

Another addition resultant to policy changes took the form of Silverbull Shares. 

> **Silverbull shares are, confusingly, not directly related to the Silverbull rank (although the latter causes one to accrue a limited type of the former)**
> 
> **In fact, it is best to think of silverbull shares as type of miniture giftcard redeemable for a set value of items from the Wynncraft Store.**
> 
> In certain cases, this giftcard may be sold via the trademarket, with the resulting in-game LE valuation of shares being whatever in-game currency people are willing to pay for (effectively) store credit. This varies.

### Redeeming Shares

If one has a silverbull share (regardless of tradability), it can be redeemed by its owner for what effectively amounts to store credit. This is to say, if one acquires enough silverbull shares, they can buy bombs, ranks, and the like.

### Acquiring Shares

Untradable shares accrue naturally as a by-product of maintaining a silverbull subscription. Tradable Shares may be purchased with liquid emeralds (on the trade market, resultant to others selling them per the below) or IRL currency (on the store). 

### Selling Shares

If one's share is not untradable (i.e. not the result of a silverbull subscription), it may be listed on the trade market. People can then bid however much in-game currency they feel store credits are worth.

### Trading Shares

Note that, despite being called 'tradable', silverbull shares are not, in fact, tradable. They cannot exist as a physical item in the game, and instead exist as part of the trade market and store menus. Therefore, although tradable shares can be sold, they can not be used with /trade .
