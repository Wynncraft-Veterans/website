This guide aims to acquaint pre-spellbound players with the broad strokes of changes implemented between Wynn versions 2.0 and 2.0.4.

It aims to explain in broad strokes how such changes are relevant to modern gameplay and provide enough information to get started with the mentioned features.

This is **not a changelog**, and this is also **not a guide**. For exact changes, see the changelogs linked on [the wiki](https://wynncraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Version_history).

## Festivals

<small>Section written by Wenweia</small>

### Festival Seasons
Previously, Wynn wouuld organise a unique event or quest for each major holiday. These have been standardised and replaced with a rotation of four seasonal festivals. Each festival redecorates detlas, has an event area reachable from detlas, implements some recurring minigames, and adds some cosmetics.

*Wynnter/Craftsmas* festivities were replaced with the *Festival of the Blizzard* (Winter) and *Hallowynn* festivities were replaced with the *Festival of the Spirits* (Autumn). Although spring and summer did not previously have their own events, they do now in the form of the *Festival of  the Heroes* (Spring) and the *Festival of the Bonfire* (Summer).

### Isles of Fiction
With the systemisation of seasonal content, unique items introduced in past holiday events are can now be accessed year-round via a newly introduced merchant island. For inflated prices, merchants on the Isles of Fiction will sell you armour, accessories, weapons, and the like temporarily introduced in past events.

## Lootruns

<small>Section written by Wenweia</small>

In older versions of the game, lootrunning was an emergant gameplay wherein players would run around the world opening as many chests as possible with as much loot bonus as possible. *This has changed.* Wynn's recent goal has been to increase the game's accessibility, and in line with that, lootrunning was made an official, user-friendly, mechanic. It's effectively a minigame now. 

Modern lootrunning entails travelling to a Lootrun Camp (there are several, each unlocked by fulfiling an assortment of prerequisites) and starting what is effectively a clock. Thereafter, *lootrunning consists of running between a bunch of nearby locations and completing various objectives*. For each objective completed, you gain additional time on your clock and an assortment of buffs/curses (akin to status effects). As you complete more and more objectives, you gain reward pulls.

Due to reward pulls and the accessibility of this mechanic, *mythic prices have dropped drastically across the board, such that they are now within reach for most players*. Items replacing mythic-priced items in rarity are shinies (described in the guide) and anni mythics (mythics that do not get dropped via lootruns, but instead spawn in via [Annhilation](https://www.wynnvets.org/docs/major-changes/rekindled/#major))

## Misc Changes

<small>Section written by Wenweia</small>

### Prof Nerf
Historically, professions were an extreme end-game time sink that required OSRS-level grinding dedication to max. Getting oneself to the maximum useful level required over a thousand hours of grinding, and getting maximum possible level required many times that.

Beginning in reborn, continued into rekindled, but especially notable in Spellbound, Wynn has made a concerted effort to reduce the severity of professions. These have included adding safer, more dense, grindspots; speciality grindspots with local experience buffs, droprate totems, gathering speed/experience ingredients, territory boosts, curve adjustments, and much more.

Having said that, despite professions now being far more accessible, they are still by no means required. And they still have the potential to suck up considerable time.

### Character Banks
Historically, everyone had one multi-page account bank, shared between all their classes and accessible via using the enderchest in many major cities. Spellbound added an *additional* set of pages per character (class). These new pages are unique in that they can only contain contents from (i.e. can only be accessed by) the class you are currently using.

> **When you first log in after returning, you may an empty bank. This is normal!**
> **Your [items] (https://www.wynnvets.org/docs/guides/old-items/) moved to your account bank!**<br>
> The new default page shown when opening an enderchest is your character bank.
> To switch to your account bank, click the chest symbol at the bottom of the UI!

## Ranks

<small>Section written by Wenweia</small>

Primarily in reaction to changing policies from Microsoft/Mojang, both the number of ranks and their contents has likely changed since you last played.

Notwithstanding some major changes in 2014 which were major enough to warrant [their own article](https://www.wynnvets.org/docs/major-changes/mobs/#eula-changes) and some major cosmetic changes in 2025 which were also major enough to warrent [their own article](https://www.wynnvets.org/docs/major-changes/rekindled/#store-stuffs), most of Wynn's store changes have been relatively gradual.

Spellbound is another example of an update that contained changes major enough to warrent their own article, and to avoid spreading out rank changes across the entire changes overview, we are going to concentrate all of that information here. Below is a broad charactarisation of Wynn's current ranks; it includes many changes made in spellbound, but also, encompasses changes made across other releases.

### Normal Ranks
Currently, Wynn's paid rank structure is as follows:
**Default < VIP < VIP+ < HERO < HERO+ < CHAMPION**
These ranks were respectively implemented after 0.0, 1.0, 1.14, 2.1, and 1.20.

Most ranks simply build on their previous ones, adding in increasing amounts of visibility perks, totems, customisation of crafted items, slots for classes and islands, bank and trade market space, housing customisation and visibility, etc.

Higher ranks also have an easier time connecting to specific servers, can have more pets, and some class-specific/niche features such as bombbell (champion). Generally, ranks are not needed to play the server, but can become useful if you stick around for a while.

Lower ranks focus on making the server more convenient to access/play on, with later ranks focusing on scaling gameplay. Therefore, *later ranks (especially champion) are generally only useful for highly invested players*, especially those who have spent way too much time on profs, those who make their in-game income trading on the market, and those who make their in-game income farming bulk ingredients.

### Subscription Ranks
Wynn added a subscription rank, Silverbull, which is billed as an addon to the normal ranks detailed above. *Silverbull is generally most useful for people who enjoy cosmetics*.

In general, for a monthly cost, it will (among other things) accrue untradable silverbull shares (effectively small giftcards only usable by yourself), incrasingly colourful armour/weapon glints (cosmetics), boost the number of crates you get, and allow you to more easily upgrade your cosmetics (via a reduced scrappinig threshold).

## Silverbull Shares

<small>Section written by Wenweia</small>

Another addition resultant to policy changes took the form of Silverbull Shares. 

> **Silverbull shares are, confusingly, not directly related to the Silverbull rank (although the latter causes one to accrue a limited type of the former)**
> 
> **In fact, it is best to think of silverbull shares as type of miniture giftcard redeemable for a set value of items from the Wynncraft Store.**
> 
> In certain cases, this giftcard may be sold via the trademarket, with the resulting in-game LE valuation of shares being whatever in-game currency people are willing to pay for (effectively) store credit. This varies.

### Redeeming Shares

If one has a silverbull share (regardless of tradability), it can be redeemed by its owner for what effectively amounts to store credit. This is to say, if one acquires enough silverbull shares, they can buy bombs, ranks, and the like.

### Acquiring Shares

Untradable shares accrue naturally as a by-product of maintaining a silverbull subscription. Tradable Shares may be purchased with liquid emeralds (on the trade market, resultant to others selling them per the below) or IRL currency (on the store). 

### Selling Shares

If one's share is not untradable (i.e. not the result of a silverbull subscription), it may be listed on the trade market. People can then bid however much in-game currency they feel store credits are worth.

### Trading Shares

Note that, despite being called 'tradable', silverbull shares are not, in fact, tradable. They cannot exist as a physical item in the game, and instead exist as part of the trade market and store menus. Therefore, although tradable shares can be sold, they can not be used with /trade .
