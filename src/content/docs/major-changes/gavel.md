This guide aims to acquaint pre-gavel players with the broad strokes of changes implemented between Wynn versions 1.14 and 1.15.

It aims to explain in broad strokes how such changes are relevant to modern gameplay and provide enough information to get started with the mentioned features.

This is **not a changelog**, and this is also **not a guide**. For exact changes, see the changelogs linked on [the wiki](https://wynncraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Version_history).

## World Expansion & Wynnpack

<div class="glass px-4 my-2 py-2"><center>Large portions of this section originate from <a href="https://forums.wynncraft.com/threads/returning-players-read-this-what-has-changed-updated.250419/" rel="external"><button class="glass font-semibold py-2 px-4 border border-gray-400 rounded shadow">Viro335's Thread</button></a></center></div>

### The Gavel Province

First of all, they added the **GAVEL PROVINCE**, a new landmass across the ocean from Wynn. You can make your way there via the seaskipper, ending up at the the quartz city of Llevigar (the province's starter town).

You will end up making your way through the province's varied  environments, completing various quests and exploring. Gavel is large and varied,  from volcanoes to swamps to floating islands.

### Wynnpack

Wynncraft now has a mandatory resource pack! This downloads automatically and retextures everything in the game. These days, the game is effectively unplayable without Wynnpack; everything is potions and unicode symbols!


## The Item System

<div class="glass px-4 my-2 py-2"><center>Large portions of this section originate from <a href="https://forums.wynncraft.com/threads/returning-players-read-this-what-has-changed-updated.250419/" rel="external"><button class="glass font-semibold py-2 px-4 border border-gray-400 rounded shadow">Viro335's Thread</button></a></center></div>

The item system was completely revamped!

### Item Identifications
Now, when you get any item other than those of the normal class, it is Unidentified and thus unusable. You must go to an item identifier and pay a small fee to identify the item. It will then be Identified and usable, although some items have skill point requirements (as in, you need [x] amount of skill points to use the item) or quest requirements. For a full list of identifications, or attributes your item gets upon identification, and what they do, visit [this wiki page](https://wynncraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Identifications).

Items now also have powder slots, which will be explained in the next section.

### Mythic Rarity
This update added a new tier of items, known as Mythic Items. The chances of finding one out of the blue were for the longest time roughly 1 in 150 000. Although there are now other, easier, ways to obtain them, they remain some of the rarer items in the game.

The game's current item tiers are Mythic > Fabled > Legendary > Rare > Unique > Normal. Set items also now exist as a tier; the more items you have of the same set, the stronger the items in question will become.

## Elements

<div class="glass px-4 my-2 py-2"><center>Large portions of this section originate from <a href="https://forums.wynncraft.com/threads/returning-players-read-this-what-has-changed-updated.250419/" rel="external"><button class="glass font-semibold py-2 px-4 border border-gray-400 rounded shadow">Viro335's Thread</button></a></center></div>

### Elements And Mobs

If a mob has a tag like ***<font color="#3cd0e4">❉</font> Weak***, that means it is weak to water damage and will take *more* water damage than your weapon normally deals. If it says ***<font color="#e43c3c">✹</font> Def*** that means it takes *less* fire damage than your weapon normally deals. If it says ***<font color="#e4e13c">✦</font> Dam***, that means it *deals* thunder damage. The full list of elements are:

- <font color="#50e43c">✤</font> Earth
- <font color="#e4e13c">✦</font> Thunder
- <font color="#3cd0e4">❉</font> Water
- <font color="#e43c3c">✹</font> Fire
- <font color="#7a7a7a">❋</font> Air
 
### Elements And Items
You may notice that your armour has IDs such as "Earth Defense: +120" or "Thunder Defense: -50". You may also notice that weapons have IDs such as Earth [Damage]: +20%. 

How do Elemental Defenses/Resistances work? They're just an addition/subtraction to weapon damage (before the spell and attack speed multipliers but after any gear damage increases/other boosts). Abusing weaknesses is much better with superfast weapons with that element, because you're just adding the weakness to each hit (also a better attack speed multiplier). Faster weaps struggle against resistances for the same reason.

Your own elemental defenses work the same way, so they don't really do much unless mobs hit rapidly/you have an extreme negative.

## Dungeons Rework
<small>Article written by Felixfex:</small>

With the exception of the Timelost Sanctum (formerly known as the Lost Sanctuary or Animal Dungeon), each Dungeon had an associated quest. Previously, these quests were required to access the dungeon, but this is no longer the case.

Completing a Dungeon rewards the Fragments/Token, a bit of XP, a few Emeralds and occasionally falling unidentified items. Every dungeon has both a minimum level requirement and a recommended level for completion.

A Dungeon Key is required to enter any dungeon. These keys are dropped by Key Guardians, which are powerful monsters found in areas with levels corresponding to their respective dungeons. Key Guardians consistently spawn in the same locations, so once you find a spawn point, they will reappear there after a short time.

### Fragments vs. Tokens
<small>Article written by Felixfex:</small>

Upon completing a dungeon, you will receive three untradable Fragments and one untradable Boss Token. 

Located near each dungeon entrance is a Dungeon Merchant NPC from whom you can purchase various [items](https://wynncraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Dungeon_Merchant). Boss Tokens can be exchanged for armor, weapons, necklaces, bracelets, and rings (generally with a few fragments also required). These items come pre-identified and are untradable, so you will need to complete the dungeons yourself to obtain them. The cost of these items ranges from one to six Tokens each.

Fragments are also used to buy Gathering Tools of corresponding levels/tiers to the dungeon, and these tools are tradable with other players.

### Corrupted vs. Uncorrupted
<small>Article written by Felixfex:</small>

As of September 2025, Wynncraft features 18 dungeons: 10 Regular and 8 Corrupted. Corrupted Dungeons are higher-level, more challenging variants of their Regular counterparts. Additionally, Regular Dungeons offer a "second chance" if you die during a run. 

While the Regular Dungeons have been significantly reworked over the years including the addition of more complex boss mechanics, the Corrupted Dungeons for the most part retain their original gameplay style as of writing. 

Regular Dungeons are scattered throughout the in-game world, whereas all Corrupted Dungeons are accessed through the Forgery, a structure built in Gavel.

To enter Corrupted Dungeons, you will need Corrupted Keys. These can be crafted by obtaining Broken Keys from Corrupted Key Guardians (or through Lootruns) and repairing them at the Keyforge Merchant in the Forgery. The crafting process requires specific runes (Nii, Uth, Tol).

For a detailed list of dungeons, including their level requirements, associated quests, locations, and bosses, visit [this wiki page](https://wynncraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Dungeons). A list of corrupted keys and their crafting costs can be found on [this wiki page](https://wynncraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Key_Forge_Merchant).

### Managing Key States
<small>Article written by Felixfex:</small>

Currently, there are 5 states of (broken or regular) dungeon keys that you can end up with:
1. Keys dropped by Key-Guardians.
2. Keys from World Events and Lootruns.
3. Keys that have interacted with the Trade Market / Bank.
4. The "Different" Keys (usually bugged).
5. Old Keys.
#### Many keys dont stack!
##### But they can be converted as follows:

- The **Market** can convert keys of the 2nd state into keys of the 3rd. The market does not impact the state of keys in the 1st or 4th states.
- Your **Bank** can convert keys from the 2nd state to the 3rd state and vise versa, after reloading with /class or switching worlds. This means that keys of the 2nd and 3rd state tend to stack after a while, thus becoming the majority of your keys.
- Through encountering assorted **bugs**, you can by accident convert keys of the 2nd and 1st state to keys of the 4th, such that they dont stack directly with any other stack. This occurs rarely.
- Lastly **Lootrun** keys can be any state other then the 5th, they mostly stack with 2nd state keys. Putting them on the market converts them into keys of the 2nd and 3rd state. (The vast majority of keys are generated by lootruns).
- There are some **old  keys** introduced before the "dungeon info" lore and associated coloured names were introduced. These don't stack at all with the other keys, and have some (albeit negligable) value as collectors items. Note that this is different from *legacy keys* (keys for dungeons that no longer exist), which are in a different value [ballpark](https://wynnvets.org/legacy-items) altogether.
> **TLDR**: You will most likely end up with two different key stacks for each key that is dropped and for event reward keys.(edited)

## ??? (Quest)
??? is a Lvl 80 quest simply titled "???" in the in-game quest book with no further information as to how to start or complete it. When it first came out, information about it was scarce, but today, its progression is widely known. You can find out how to complete it by reading the [wiki page](https://wynncraft.wiki.gg/wiki/%3F%3F%3F) or by asking an experienced player to lead you through the process.

Note that you will need **two players** besides yourself to <ins>begin</ins> the quest and **three players** besides yourself to <ins>complete</ins> the quest. It doesn't matter if they've already done it or not; they can assist you regardless. If you want to do it all in one go, make sure you have three people to help you. **You cannot complete it alone**.

One of the rewards for completing ??? is the [Cosmic Set](https://wynncraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Cosmic_Set), a set of armor useful for its high XP bonus. This set can be used for XP grinding at high levels, so long as you are able to survive while wearing it.
