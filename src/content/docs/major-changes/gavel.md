### Managing Key States
<small>Article written by Felixfex:</small>

Currently, there are 5 states of (broken or regular) dungeon keys that you can end up with:
1. Keys dropped by Key-Guardians.
2. Keys from World Events and Lootruns.
3. Keys that have interacted with the Trade Market / Bank.
4. The "Different" Keys (usually bugged).
5. Old Keys.
#### Many keys dont stack!
##### But they can be converted as follows:

- The **Market** can convert keys of the 2nd state into keys of the 3rd. The market does not impact the state of keys in the 1st or 4th states.
- Your **Bank** can convert keys from the 2nd state to the 3rd state and vise versa, after reloading with /class or switching worlds. This means that keys of the 2nd and 3rd state tend to stack after a while, thus becoming the majority of your keys.
- Through encountering assorted **bugs**, you can by accident convert keys of the 2nd and 1st state to keys of the 4th, such that they dont stack directly with any other stack. This occurs rarely.
- Lastly **Lootrun** keys can be any state other then the 5th, they mostly stack with 2nd state keys. Putting them on the market converts them into keys of the 2nd and 3rd state. (The vast majority of keys are generated by lootruns).
- There are some **old  keys** introduced before the "dungeon info" lore and associated coloured names were introduced. These don't stack at all with the other keys, and have some (albeit negligable) value as collectors items. Note that this is different from *legacy keys* (keys for dungeons that no longer exist), which are in a different value [ballpark](https://wynnvets.org/legacy-items) altogether.
> **TLDR**: You will most likely end up with two different key stacks for each key that is dropped and for event reward keys.(edited)

## ??? (Quest)
??? is a Lvl 80 quest simply titled "???" in the in-game quest book with no further information as to how to start or complete it. When it first came out, information about it was scarce, but today, its progression is widely known. You can find out how to complete it by reading the [wiki page](https://wynncraft.wiki.gg/wiki/%3F%3F%3F) or by asking an experienced player to lead you through the process.

Note that you will need **two players** besides yourself to <ins>begin</ins> the quest and **three players** besides yourself to <ins>complete</ins> the quest. It doesn't matter if they've already done it or not; they can assist you regardless. If you want to do it all in one go, make sure you have three people to help you. **You cannot complete it alone**.

One of the rewards for completing ??? is the [Cosmic Set](https://wynncraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Cosmic_Set), a set of armor useful for its high XP bonus. This set can be used for XP grinding at high levels, so long as you are able to survive while wearing it.
