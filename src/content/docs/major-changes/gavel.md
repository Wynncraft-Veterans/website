<small>Article written by Metrafish:</small>
## ??? (Quest)
??? is a Lvl 80 quest simply titled "???" in the in-game quest book with no further information as to how to start or complete it. When it first came out, information about it was scarce, but today, its progression is widely known. You can find out how to complete it by reading the [wiki page](https://wynncraft.wiki.gg/wiki/%3F%3F%3F) or by asking an experienced player to lead you through the process.

Note that you will need **two players** besides yourself to <ins>begin</ins> the quest and **three players** besides yourself to <ins>complete</ins> the quest. It doesn't matter if they've already done it or not; they can assist you regardless. If you want to do it all in one go, make sure you have three people to help you. **You cannot complete it alone**.

One of the rewards for completing ??? is the [Cosmic Set](https://wynncraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Cosmic_Set), a set of armor useful for its high XP bonus. This set can be used for XP grinding at high levels, so long as you are able to survive while wearing it.
