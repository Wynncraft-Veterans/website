## Map Expansion

<small>Article written by Wenweia:</small>

Formerly known as the Road to Dern, the Silent Expanse is an area of the Wynn Province that was consumed by the Realm of Dern (an update slated for the future). In order to enter the Expanse and gain access to its content, you will have to go through the endgame quests A Journey Beyond and A Journey  Further. 

## The Shaman Class

<div class="glass px-4 my-2 py-2"><center>Large portions of this section originate from <a href="https://forums.wynncraft.com/threads/returning-players-read-this-what-has-changed-updated.250419/" rel="external"><button class="glass font-semibold py-2 px-4 border border-gray-400 rounded shadow">Viro335's Thread</button></a></center></div>

For the first time since release, this update added a completely new class, the Shaman. The theme of shaman is a squishy class with AOE spells and abilities relative to a totem. Notwithstanding abilities added in subsequent years, shaman's base spells are Totem (spawns a physical totem object and throws it in front of your character), Haul (pulls oneself towards said totem), Aura (does damage within a certain radius of said totem), and Uproot (a ranged blast spell, unique for shaman in that it does not involve the Totem).

More information on this class will be outlined in subsequent sections due to an update a few years alter that overhauled classes to incorporate archetype variants.

## Player Ghosts
<small>Article written by Wenweia:</small>

Player ghosts are, as the name implies, ghosts of players on other worlds. They are enabled by default and are semitransparent. 

Playerghosts are not fully interactable in that, although you can talk to them and they can see your actions, they can't damage mobs on your server nor can they join you in quests or other local activities.

If you are experiencing lag, you can `/toggle playerghosts none` to hide all other players from other worlds. Conversely, if you are lonely, you can `/toggle playerghosts all` to do the opposite and display all players from all worlds.

## Item Changes
<small>Article written by Wenweia:</small>

### Fabled Rarity
This update added a new rarity, fabled! Although technically between legendary and mythic, it is best to think of fabled items as slightly rarer legendary items that often have a unique gimic, usually a major identification (below):

### Major Identifications
Present on many mythic and fabled items as cyan text at the bottom, major identifications are extra properties unique to an item. Generally, when holding or wearing such items, additional wynnscript runs on your character, slightly changing your gameplay in ways described by the identification itself.

In the following example, this fabled item has Dauntless Inferno, a major id. Note that major ids are intrinsic to items themselves, cannot be removed/added, and are not variable (i.e. not subject to luck-based identification rolling mechanics).

## Hunted Gamemode
<small>Article written by Metrafish:</small>

A [challenge gamemode](/docs/major-changes/economy#challenge-gamemodes) that rewards players with +50% mob XP and 50% gathering XP, but at the cost of other players within a 10 level range of you being able to attack you via PVP.

Being killed by another player in hunted mode causes some of your gear to drop.

## Ingredient Pouch
<small>Article written by Wenweia:</small>

Shortly after professions (and the ingredients associated with them) were added, a new utility slot got added to the inventory to accomodate the myriad of new items. This slot only accepts ingredients (and has a built-in option to blacksmith them), automatically collects any ingredients you pick up (as long as you have at least one open slot), and offers storage for up to 27 ingredient types and 1728 items (i.e. it is a 9x3x64 chest).

Note that there are two common exceptions to the above:
1. If you are a returning player who happened to have an item in that particular slot of your inventory when the pouch got added, said item will be put into your ingredient pouch. This is quite common among returning players, and is probably how you ended up with a single helmet in your ingredient pouch.
2. If you are playing the [UltraIronman]((/docs/major-changes/economy#challenge-gamemodes) challenge (previously known as normal ironman), you can use your pouch without any restrictions (as you would use a class bank, if you had one).
