### Charms
<small>Section by JustGatze</small>

​	Charms are a new type of items which are active by just being in your inventory. These items are received as rewards from raids and, unlike other items, provide effect when placed anywhere in your inventory (except for your bank). Usually, charms have a downside in addition to their upside.

​	As with most other items, charms have identifications and, therefore, their quality depends on your RNG luck when rolling them. Currently, there are four different raids in the game, and therefore four different charms.
