This guide aims to acquaint pre-reborn players with the broad strokes of changes implemented between Wynn versions 1.20 and 1.20.4.

It aims to explain in broad strokes how such changes are relevant to modern gameplay and provide enough information to get started with the mentioned features.

This is **not a changelog**, and this is also **not a guide**. For exact changes, see the changelogs linked on [the wiki](https://wynncraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Version_history).

### NPCS
<small>Section written by Wenweia</small>
	There are several types of utility NPCs exclusive to islands! In addition to purely cosmetic ones (such as message boards), and decorative / decofunctional ones (teleporters and furniture), several NPCs now have gameplay uses!

​	Misc bins are like another bank! They are per-account (not per island or per class), and can store anything that isn't an item. They are a perfect solution to powders, quest items, ingredients, and the like clogging up your bank pages. Likewise, the tome shelf is another bank, albeit only for storing your excess tomes (see below).

​	Build stands are ranklocked armour stands that can store an entire build (skill points, items, etc, albeit not skill trees) and item pedestals can display a single item. Both of these NPCs have historically been buggy, and as such, people are often hesitant to put overly valuable things in them.

## Party Finder
<small>Section by Wenweia</small>
	Another new system/NPC is the party finder! Ever wanted to find people to do a dungeon with, to help with a quest, or to grind something? Finding them just got a lot easier! Added due to the fact that raids require multiple people to function, the party finder simply aggregates together people looking to form a party around some end. In certain cases (raids, events, etc) they will also notify random people with chat reminders in an attempt to find people to join you. 

## New Item Types

### Charms
<small>Section by JustGatze</small>

​	Charms are a new type of items which are active by just being in your inventory. These items are received as rewards from raids and, unlike other items, provide effect when placed anywhere in your inventory (except for your bank). Usually, charms have a downside in addition to their upside.

​	As with most other items, charms have identifications and, therefore, their quality depends on your RNG luck when rolling them. Currently, there are four different raids in the game, and therefore four different charms.

### Amplifiers

<small>Section written by Wenweia</small>

​	Corkian amplifiers are a new type of reward that primarily appear through raids. T1 amps are very common, T2 amps are fairly common, and T3 amps are less common (your guild probably has a bunch floating around their bank for you to use).

​	These items simply slightly boost the rolls you receive on items after you identify them (T1 amps give the smallest boost, T3 amps give you the strongest). This isn't always enough to counteract your luck though; if you have [terrible luck](https://www.wynnvets.org/docs/guild/culture/#wenluck--arxluck), it is still possible to end up with a truly bad roll despite having used amplifiers.

### Emerald Pouches

<small>Section written by Wenweia</small>

​	Wynn added another way to store items! This is not a slot, per se, but rather an item that can consume other items for storage. Imagine an emerald pouch as a little portable chest that only holds emeralds and emerald derivatives. If currency enters your inventory, it will be consumed by your pouch (if your pouch is a high enough level to hold it; t7 pouches can hold liquid emeralds, anything beyond that is pretty much a vanity item). If you buy something, the merchant and/or trademarket will consume emeralds from your pouch. If you need to access your emeralds, you can right click on the pouch.
