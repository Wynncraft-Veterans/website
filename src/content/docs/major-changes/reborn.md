## New Item Types

### Charms
<small>Section by JustGatze</small>

​	Charms are a new type of items which are active by just being in your inventory. These items are received as rewards from raids and, unlike other items, provide effect when placed anywhere in your inventory (except for your bank). Usually, charms have a downside in addition to their upside.

​	As with most other items, charms have identifications and, therefore, their quality depends on your RNG luck when rolling them. Currently, there are four different raids in the game, and therefore four different charms.

- **Charm of the Worm**
  - Can be obtained  from the *Nest of the Grootslang* raid, and grants the player bonus combat XP from Lv. 60-80 content.

  - Can be obtained from the *Orphion's Nexus of Light* raid, and grants the player bonus combat XP from Lv. 80-100 content.
- **Charm of the Stone**
  - Can be obtained from the *The Canyon Colussus* raid, and grants the player bonus loot from Lv. 90-110 content.

### Amplifiers

<small>Section written by Wenweia</small>

​	Corkian amplifiers are a new type of reward that primarily appear through raids. T1 amps are very common, T2 amps are fairly common, and T3 amps are less common (your guild probably has a bunch floating around their bank for you to use).

​	These items simply slightly boost the rolls you receive on items after you identify them (T1 amps give the smallest boost, T3 amps give you the strongest). This isn't always enough to counteract your luck though; if you have [terrible luck](https://www.wynnvets.org/docs/guild/culture/#wenluck--arxluck), it is still possible to end up with a truly bad roll despite having used amplifiers.

### Emerald Pouches

<small>Section written by Wenweia</small>

​	Wynn added another way to store items! This is not a slot, per se, but rather an item that can consume other items for storage. Imagine an emerald pouch as a little portable chest that only holds emeralds and emerald derivatives. If currency enters your inventory, it will be consumed by your pouch (if your pouch is a high enough level to hold it; t7 pouches can hold liquid emeralds, anything beyond that is pretty much a vanity item). If you buy something, the merchant and/or trademarket will consume emeralds from your pouch. If you need to access your emeralds, you can right click on the pouch.
