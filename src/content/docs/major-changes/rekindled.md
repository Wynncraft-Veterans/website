This guide aims to acquaint pre-rekindled players with the broad strokes of changes implemented since Wynn version 2.1.

It aims to explain in broad strokes how such changes are relevant to modern gameplay and provide enough information to get started with the mentioned features.

This is **not a changelog**, and this is also **not a guide**. For exact changes, see the changelogs linked on [the wiki](https://wynncraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Version_history).

*Note: This update also featured a pretty fundamental overhaul of the guild warring system, which will be ignored for the purposes of this guide.*
