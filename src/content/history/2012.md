# Prototype Development 

Before we cover Wynn's history, we need to talk about CraftedMovie, the previous Minecraft project Salted had a hand in.

 CraftedMovie (abbreviated as CM from this point on) refers to either a  server or a youtube channel. The youtube channel began uploading  Minecraft videos around 2011, and you'll spot a lot of familiar faces  (and builds!) in their videos. Their more iconic projects include  "Mirrors in Minecraft?", "Lion King in Minecraft (circle of life)", and  the 3-part Misadventure on the Sea series. The channel amassed hundreds  of thousands of subscribers, but sadly, CM isn't really a thing anymore, with their last video being released in 2015.

 The CM server was a whitelisted survival server with a very tight-knit  community. It's also how Wynn's admins met many of their eventual  builders and mods. Sadly, the server isn't really a thing either.

 Eventually, Salted got the idea to make a MMORPG in Minecraft, and he  decided to drag his friends Grian, Jumla, and Crunkle along for the  ride. Rounding out this initial team of admins was Tama63 and  HiMyNameIsAJ, two web developers who have sadly left Wynn.

 Wynncraft wasn't built in a day. The secret "Project W" was built and  coded over almost six months, and it grew from a plains city named Ragni to a large map featuring three dungeons, five cities, and several  smaller towns and points of interest. Wynn was ready for release.
