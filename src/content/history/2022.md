## Spellbound Hype (January - September)
Not long after 1.20.4 came out, teasers for the next update, presumed to be 1.21 at the time, began. They were pretty cryptic, and it was hard to discern what would happen apart from some build revamps and a rework to Galleon's Graveyard. In particular, the Nameless Anomaly raid was hinted at through a lot of pictures of plants.

But hype went into overdrive when it was revealed that the update was being rebranded to Wynncraft 2.0. Shortly after the trailer dropped, showing everyone the upcoming ability tree, the Nameless Anomaly raid, and new content Gavel would have.

Despite the trailer dropping in May, a lot of work needed to be done before the update finally released. It took almost two months before the beta dropped, which then led to a long testing period where people slowly got access to classes to test as time went on. The beta ended up lasting nearly three months, a record for the server. And even with it, balance wasn't perfect (as classes were intended mainly to be playable and fun, with balance patches coming after), and the controversial Ability Shards were added at the last minute. Spellbound finally released the same day the queen of england died.

It seems as if 2.0 had a lot of positives. The Nameless Anomaly raid seems regarded as the best raid yet, and acts as a great source of getting money. A lot of new quests have been received, and Galleon's Graveyard seems regarded as a step up from the original.

## Post 2.0 Content (September to December)

Not all of Spellbound's features arrived on time. The Breaking Point  quest and Corrupted Galleon's Graveyard had to release with 2.0.1, which also brought changes to the boss Charon and a lot of balance changes.

 Around the time 2.0.1 beta testing started, the 2nd iteration of the  Festival of the Bonfire was wrapping up. This version featured new and  old cosmetics and events, but the highlight was the Battle for the  Bonfire minigame. This was more comparable to Wizard Fortress than the  Wynnter Fair, transforming the game into an entertaining FPS with cool  prizes to win. Later in December, the Festival of the Blizzard also made a comeback too.

## Fruma Teaser (November)

In what I believe to be a completely unexpected announcement, Salted  announced in the middle of November that their next update will  (probably) be Fruma. Fruma, the province we originated from, has been  teased since 2015 and we've slowly learned more and more about it. Not  only that, but it seems as if it will be the next endgame content, as it will raise the level cap.
