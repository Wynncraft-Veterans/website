## Corkus (April)
Corkus was a suggestion writted by MrCoffeeTime, and for some reason the Content Team loved it. This led to an official April Fools thread in  2016 by gamemaster Tantibus, which claimed Corkus was coming to the  game. What no one could have predicated was that Corkus is actually  real, it got officially hinted at in 1.14.1! Towards the end of 2016,  Grian hosted a livestream detailing what Corkus would contain. 1.15 then added the island, which had only the coastline accessible. And then in  April was got the full thing, *The Corkus Update*, complete with four quests, many secrets, and a new dungeon!

 MrCoffeeTime's suggestion mentioned a place known as Legendary Island,  and that's a name you probably recognize. Legendary Island became THE  endgame content, and is just as popular today as it was back then  (although it took a while for the challenge runs to catch on). The other huge addition of 1.16 was the Corrupted Sand-Swept Tomb. Prior to its  revamp two years later, the dungeon could be completed very quickly.  Still, it wasn't a huge source of XP... until dungeon bombs were added a month later. This led to the rise of CSST parties, which allowed  players to level up in groups ultra-rapidly. It became quite common to   see players who had never done a quest past level 71 just because they  ran CSST so much.

## Future Update Announcements (June)
In June, Grian posted a [thread](https://forums.wynncraft.com/threads/an-update-on-the-1-17-update.194506/) teasing the upcoming updates. We didn't get much info on 1.17, the  upcoming update, but we did get a surprisingly large teaser for the next one: it would be the "Road to Dern" update. Dern, much like Gavel, had  been hinted at since 2013. Naturally people were quite excited for this. Things sadly didn't go as planned however, and in what was considered a divisive move at the time, RtD announced as pushed from being 1.18 to  1.19 in late 2018.

 Grian's teaser also mentioned that 1.17 would focus on content over  coding gameplay changes. This was a result of the server's refractor  being worked on, AKA code improvements.

## 1.17 and Bugfixes (November - December)
Unfortunately, after the frequent string of update releases, there ended up being quite a large content drought after Corkus. Many believed the  was due to work on the "refractor", aka code improvements. Much like  after Gavel, people acknowledged that the game had flaws and hoped the  next update would fix them. Interestingly enough, Wynncraft was saved  less by the next update, and more by somewhat unrelated events.

 Around November, the admin jpresent (who had been around for a while but never seemed to do much) started doing a TON of bugfixes. Needless to  say, the community was really happy about this. He fixed lag apparently! The other cool thing around this time was mythic balancing (finally),  and the introduction of the Item Team. Yes, only Salted and Selvut were  able to change items before 1.17 came out! The ways IDs were rounded was also changed to what it was today, and this decision was a bit more  controversial at the time.

 Of course, all of these events should discount the impact of 1.17, which was a very cool update in it's own right. The *Dungeons and Discoveries Update* added true discoveries, a lot of new quests, and some long-awaited suggestions: a better quest book and more bank space!

## Other Events in 2017

- Wynncraft switched over from Teamspeak to Discord, leading to the  place you all know and love today. Yes this happened in 2016 but it was  really late that year so
- Wynncraft gets a Guinness World Record for being the largest Minecraft MMORPG.
- Mod applications open up, allowing people to apply for the funny orange juice rank.
- Pretzule hosts many events and smaller mini-events along with the mod team.
- Player Motoki1 figures out damage calculations, which paves the way  for dukioooo's website WynnData, and eventually hppeng's WynnBuilder  site today.
