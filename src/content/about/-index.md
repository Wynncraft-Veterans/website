If it has been several years since you last played on [Wynncraft](https://wynncraft.com), you have come to the right place! This community-run website aims to provide a crash course on the current state of the game.
<br><br>
#### What can be found here?
In particular, this site hopes to bring you up to date with all the *fundamental* (system-overhauling) updates the game has underwent this past decade. It hopes to introduce you to the server's current subcommunities, provide you with tutorials and resources on current gameplay mechanics, and serve as a directory of the major 3rd party resources commonly used by Wynn's playerbase.

#### Who made this?
In 2024, a group of 2010s players returned to the game to find that their friends and guilds had long since moved on from the Wynn. Banding together to get reaquainted with the game's many changes, the resulting friend group soon realised that this situation was actually quite common. This became the in-game [VETS](https://wynncraft.com/stats/guild/Returners) guild and the [Veterans Discord](https://discord.gg/GqkSC42dve).
