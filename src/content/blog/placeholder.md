When [Wynncraft](https://wynncraft.com) was founded, the internet made frequent use of blogs, forums, and the like. For unrelated reasons, this website has a blog.

The problem is, since most of us live on discord, we generally prefer to use that. Our [announcements channel](https://wynnvets.org/discord) functions as something of a blog, so we prefer to use that.

As such, we haven't really found a use for this blog. It exists if needed, but other than that, it is safe to forget about.
